If the numerator is larger than the denominator then it is called an **improper fraction**, which can also be written as a **mixed fraction**, such as: $\\frac{14}{5}$ or $2\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\n## Reducing Fractions\nFractions for math problems are not considered correct until they have been as **reduced** as possible. Reducing a fraction doesn't change it's value, but it does get rid of any unnecessary divisions.\n\nFor example, say you wanted 2 pieces of an 8 piece pie. That's all well and good, but that is actually the same amount of pie you would get if you divided it into 4ths and took only 1 piece. So we can say:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nTo reduce a fraction, find the largest factor that multiply into both the numerator and the denominator, or the **greatest common factor**. In the above example, it's pretty easy.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2\\cdot1=2 \\\\ \n2\\cdot4=8\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWe can see that 2 goes in to both 2 and 8, so we reduce it by dividing both by 2 and we get $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n## Multiplying and Dividing Fractions\nTo multiply fractions, you simply multiply straight across. In other words, you multiply the denominator by the denominator, and then multiply the numerator by the numerator. Then reduce, if needed.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{6}{5}=\\frac{1\\cdot6}{3\\cdot5}=\\frac{6}{15}\n$$\nTo divide fractions, you first find the **reciprocal** of the divisor (which is simply the same thing but flipped), then multiply that as normal and reduce if needed.\n$$\n\\frac{7}{9}\\div\\frac{5}{3}=\\frac{7}{9}\\cdot\\frac{3}{5}=\\frac{7\\cdot3}{9\\cdot5}=\\frac{21}{45}=\\frac{7}{15}\n$$\n\n## Adding and Subtracting Fractions\n> Hello viewers on the internet!

To get the denominators to match, you must find the **least common denominator**. For example, take the following fractions:\n$$\n\\frac{4}{5}+\\frac{3}{8}\n$$...first you must determine what is the lowest number that both 5 and 8 are factors of, or the **least common multiple**. You'll definitely get there if you simply multiply them together, but that is not always the lowest multiple\u2014but in this case it is! So we'll multiply both fractions by whatever it takes to get us to the LCD.\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\n(\\frac{8}{8}\\cdot\\frac{4}{5})+(\\frac{5}{5}\\cdot\\frac{3}{8})\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\frac{32}{40}+\\frac{15}{40}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\nNow you just add the numerators and keep the denominators the same, and [[#Reducing Fractions|reduce]] the resulting fraction (if needed).\n$$\n\\frac{32}{40}+\\frac{15}{40}=\\frac{47}{40}\n$$\n\n## Cross Multiplication\n**Cross multiplication** is used as a way to compare fractions. You multiply both denominators by the opposite numerators.\n\nOn reason you might do this is if you are trying to compare two fractions to see which is the larger. For example:\n$$\n\\begin{gather*}\n\\frac{4}{26} \\neq \\frac{7}{32}\n\\\\\n\\\\\n4\\cdot32 \\neq 7\\cdot26\n\\\\\n\\\\\n128<182\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\frac{4}{26} < \\frac{7}{32}\n\\end{gather*}\n$$\nAnother reason you might want to cross multiply is to [[algebra|solve for x]].\n$$\n\\begin{gather}\n\\frac{9}{16}=\\frac{x}{27}\n\\\\\\\\\n9\\cdot27=16x\n\\\\\\\\\n243 = 16x\n\\\\\\\\\n\\frac{243}{16}=\\frac{16x}{16}\n\\\\\\\\\n\\frac{243}{16}=x\n\\end{gather}\n$$\n\n\n___\n", "tags": ["Reducing"], "links": ["mathematics", "algebra"]}, {"title": "burnout", "text": "---\naliases: [compassion fatigue]\ntags: [nursing, psych]\n---\n# burnout\n---\n**burnout**\n\n[[stress]]\n\n\n\n3 Primary Aspects:\n\n**Emotional exhaustion**- overwhelmed, helpless & hopeless Change in conditions from\nstressful to traumatic.\nNot being able to provide a quality care on time due to too many patients (Pt. to provider\nunsafe ratio 1:16, charting, paperworks, treatments plans, extra side duties.)\nUnderstaffing due to silent quitting/ walkout/ callouts.\n\n**Detachment** - less empathy towards others, eg: it's just a work.\n\n**Lack of personal accomplishment**- lack of feeling competent enough\n\nHow are patients affected?\nMORE INFECTIONS\n\nMore Mistakes\n\nLower Ratings\n\n## Compassion Fatigue\n**Compassion fatigue** \n\n\n\n\n\n___", "tags": [], "links": ["stress"]}, {"title": "pattern recognition receptor", "text": "---\naliases: [NOD-like receptor, RIG-like receptor]\ntags: [biology, microbiology, immune]\n---\n# Pattern Recognition Receptors\n---\n**Pattern recognition receptors** or **PRRs** are receptors that are (primarily) found on the membranes and in the cytoplasm of [[innate immune system#Innate Immune Cells|innate immune cells]] that specifically recoginize molecules associated with pathogens.

It is determined by the difference between the blood that is in the heart at the end of [[cardiac cycle#Diastole|end of diastole]], (the **EDV**) and the amount of blood that is left in the heart at the [[cardiac cycle#Systole|end of systole]] (the **ESV**).

This raises the amount of blood ejected from the heart, increasing the total stroke volume.\n\nExercise increases venous return and, therefore, EDV.

The degree to which the ventricles are stretched by the end diastolic volume (EDV) is referred to as the preload. Thus, the preload results from the amount of ventricular filling between strokes, or the magnitude of the EDV.

Generally speaking, there are two rules: electrons go where it's the least expensive to join (either because it's closer to the nucleus or has an eaiser shell type to join), and electrons would rather be alone if they can be, but will pair up before jumping to a higher shell energy level.\n\n### Shells & Subshells\nThe **shell** number represents how close that shell is to the nucleus of the atom. It starts at 1 and goes up from there\u2014sometimes they are refered to with letters instead, in which case it goes from the letter L upwards. Each shell is comprised one or more **subshells**, which are labeled in order *s*, *p*, *d*, *f*, *g*.

All atoms seek to fill it's valence shell, and how close to empty or full the shell is determines an atoms reactivity. [[element#Noble Gas|Noble gases]] get their name because they are so nonreactive, which is because their valence shells are naturally (at neutral charge) full. \n\nThe **octect rule** is a chemical rule of thumb that states atoms are happiest if they have 8 (usually) electrons in their valance shell.

Communication is reflected in the [[QSEN competencies#Teamwork & Collaboration|QSEN competency]] of Teamwork & Collaboration. Effective communication is also crucial for [[conflict]].\n\nEffective communication **prevents errors**. The Joint Commission found that team communication breakdowns were the root cause of preventable [[sentinel event]] in 68% of the cases. Additionally, the greatest determinant of ICU death rates is *how well the nurse and physician worked together* in planning and providing care.\n\nThe **transactional model of communication** emphasizes that when two people communicate with one another\u2014just once or even over multiple conversations\u2014they are constantly bouncing off each other, which acts to gradually build up a shared understanding or meaning.\n\n## Levels of Communication\nThe levels of communication range from the daily, ritualistic communication you can have with just about everyone (\"Hi, how are you?\" \"Fine, thanks.\") to the level of rapport, or a friendly, harmonious relationship.

The hair root is compleatly below the surface of the skin and still attached to the walls of the follicle and bulb.\n\nThe hair can also be divided longitudially, where it has two or three seperate sections, the **medulla**, the **cortex** and the **cuticle**. Not every hair has a medulla, but if it's present it's the very center of the fiber and is made of soft, flexible keratin. The **cortex** is the middle-inside layer that is comprised of hard squished together [[epidermis#Keratinocytes Keratin|keratinocytes]]. The **cuticle** is the very outside layer and is very thin, very tough keratinized cells.\n\n## Hair Growth\nThe hair growth of each individual hair occurs in three stages, the **anagen**, the **catagen** and the **telogen** stages. We loose and replace about 50 hairs a day.\n\nThe **anagen** phase last for about 2-7 years and is when there is a lot of dividing of basal cells which pushes the hair fiber up and out. During this phase hair grows at about 0.3 mm per day. The **catagen** phase lasts about 2-3 weeks and is just the transition phase between it actively growing or not. The **telogen** phase lasts about 2-4 months is where there is no new growth and the hair follicle is at rest. At the end of the telogen phase the anagen phase begins again.\n___\n", "tags": ["Stratum", "Keratinocytes", "Hyaline"], "links": ["capillaries", "melanocytes", "dermis", "epidermis", "body temperature", "basement membrane", "nerves", "integumentary system"]}, {"title": "diuretics", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [medicine]\n---\n# Diuretics\n---\n**Diuretics** are a substance that increase the rate of [[bladder|urination]].\n\nSome work by *exceeding* the ability of the renal tubule to perform [[tubular reabsorption|reabsorption]].

One is able to put their full weight on crutches, so they are more hardy than simple canes.\n\nCrutches can be used in a two, three, or four-point gait, or with the swing-through method. The two-point gait can be used when one or both legs are only mildly impared; the three-point gait can be used when one leg is unable to bear weight (the crutches move with the bad foot); the four-point gait is used when both legs are strongly impared; the swing-through gait is also used when only one leg is impared.  \n\n![[crutch gaits.png]]\n\n### Axillary & Forearm Crutches\n**Axillary crutches** are used for temporary restrictions on mobility, and are held in under the armpits (but one's weight should never be supported by the armpits).

We know a lot of what happens *during* sleep, and the *effects* of sleep, but the *purpose* of sleep is still a bit of a mystery. Sleep provides major physiological restoration, maintains biological functions, lets our heart and lungs rest (with lower BP, pulse, and respiration rate), allows the body to release [[growth hormone]] (which makes it super important for children who are growing), and do protein syntheses and cell division, and strengthens the immune system as well.\n\nWhen we sleep is also heavily influenced by our [[circadian rhythm]], or our \"internal clock\" (roughly 24 hours a cycle).\n\n## Reticular Activating System (RAS)\nThe **reticular activating system** or the **RAS** is a structure located in the [[hypothalamus]] that acts as the control center for sleep. It is responsible for regulating wakefulness and the sleep-wake transition. It also facilitates reflex and voluntary movements during sleep.\n\n## Phases of Sleep\nThere are two broad phases of sleep, **NREM** and **REM** sleep\n\n>[!biology] Dreams\n>**Dreams** can occur in both NREM and REM, but REM dreams are much more vivid and vibrant.\n\n### NREM Sleep\n**NREM sleep** (non-rapid eye movement) is the type of sleep we spend most of the night in. It consists of three stages:\n- Stage 1: Drifting off. Your body slows down and you're eyes are closed, but you are easily roused. If you are roused you may not feel like you were asleep. This stage is when you might feel a hypnic jerk. Typically lasts 5-10 minutes.\n- Stage 2: Light sleep. Your [[heart rate]] and [[body temperature]] lower, your muscles alternate between toned and relaxed, your brain waves slows. Typically lasts around 20 minutes.\n- Stage 3: Deep sleep. You have completely no eye movement or muscle activity. Your brain produces delta waves (very slow). If you are aroused in this stage you feel groggy and disoriented. This is when a lot of the brain work of sleep happens, where your [[encoding|encode]] information and experiences. Typically lasts around 30 minutes.\n\n### REM Sleep\n**REM sleep** (rapid eye movement) is the most \"active\" part of sleep as well as the easiest to wake from. During this stage you are also [[encoding]] memories, but it's thought to lean more towards processing emotions and emotional memories, which helps us adapt to [[stress]]. The initial REM cycle of the night may only last for 1 to 5 minutes, and it gradually increases as the sleep continues up to about 90 minutes. You typically spend 20-25% of sleep in REM. \n\nAs we [[older adult]] age we spend less and less time in REM sleep.\n\n## Sleep Cycles\nIn a healthy adult, the phases of sleep cycle throughout the night in a predictable pattern. We start in NREM sleep and progress to deep sleep, then we move up into REM. This is one cycle. We typically complete about 4-5 sleep cycles a night. \n\nUnfortunately it doesn't always go so smoothly. Sleep can become fragmented and cause a [[#Problems with Sleep|host of problems]].\n\n![[sleep cycles.png]]\n(Note on above: Scientists now combine what used to be stage 3 and 4.)\n\n## Factors Influencing Sleep\n- **Drugs and substances**: hypnotics, diuretics, narcotics, antidepressants, alcohol, caffeine, beta-blockers, anticonvulsants.\n\t- **Food/calorie intake**: time of day\n- **Lifestyle**: work schedule, social activities, routines, [[#sleep hygiene]]\n\t- **Unusual sleep patterns**: disruptions due to social activity or work environments\n- **Emotional stress**: worries, physical health, death, loss\n- **Exercise and fatigue**: moderate exercise and fatigue promote restful sleep\n- **Culture**: beliefs, practices, rituals\n- **Environment**: noise, routines\n- **Illness**: may interfere with sleep or cause one to sleep more.\n\n### Sleep Hygiene\n**Sleep hygiene** is the set of practices that a person associates with sleep. Like regular hygiene it can be healthy or unhealthy, depending on how conducive to sleep those practices are. \n\n## Problems with Sleep\nThere are a lot of problems that affect ones sleep. Some can be improved with better sleep hygiene or meds. Keeping a sleep diary can help determine what the problem is/potential solutions\n\n>[!info]- Sleep Diary\n>A **sleep diary** can be a good idea to do when determining the causes and potential solutions for sleeping problems. They are usually kept for about 14 days then you can look at it an analyze it. A sleep diary keeps track of the:\n>- Time patient retires\n>- Time patient tries to fall asleep\n>- Approximate time patient falls asleep\n>- Time of any awakening during the night and resumption of sleep\n>- Time of awakening in morning\n>- Presence of any stressors affecting sleep\n>- Record of food, drink, or medication affecting sleep\n>- Record of physical and mental activities\n>- Record of activities performed 2 to 3 hours before bedtime\n>- Presence of worries or anxieties affecting sleep\n\n- [[insomnia]] - an inability to fall asleep or stay asleep\n- [[sleep apnea]] - when you stop breathing during sleep\n- [[central disorders of hypersomnolence]] - when you sleep too much\n- [[restless leg syndrome]] - an uncomfortable sensation in the lower extremities that prevent sleep\n- [[sleep deprivation]] - when you're prevented from sleeping for a long period of time.\n- [[circadian rhythm#Circadian Rhythm Disorders|circadian rhythm disorders]] - problems with one's internal circadian rhythm\n\n>[!tip]- Sleep and COVID\nCOVID is linked to sleep disturbances. During lockdown there was a 15% increase in prescription meds for helping sleep.

We, as in all life, are metabolizing 100% of the time. The building blocks of life, the [[macromolecules]] and other [[nutrients]] are being constantly built and constantly harvested. Harnessing metabolism and controlling its flow has been the single most important event in the [[evolution]] of life.\n\nThe map below is a representation of every [[#Metabolic Pathways|metabolic pathway]] that humans undergo.

Everything in biology is going from substrate to product to substrate to product, but in these metabolic pathways this process happens very quickly. They are incredibly intricate and complicated process, often requiring many critical [[enzyme|enzymes]].\n\n### Anabolic & Catabolic Reactions\nMetabolic pathways either break down large molecules during [[catabolism]] or build up smaller molecules *into* those large molecules during [[anabolism]].  Cells can harvest energy when they are storing away their building blocks, then use that energy later to build up larger structures.\n\n![[catabolism and anabolism.png]]\n\n### Energetic Coupling\nBecause a lot of these anabolic reactions are really expensive, most reactions are [[endergonic and exergonic#Energetic Coupling|coupled]] such that reactions that *produce* energy are combined with those that *cost* energy. By doing so, this makes the pathways as efficient as possible.\n\nOften times enzymes are even coupled next to each other in such a way that they can pass along their products directly to the next enzyme in the pathway.\n\n## Types of Metabolizers\nIn order to classify different organisms by what they metabolize, first we must establish the four things all organisms need to survive:\n- A **source** of **electrons** (or in other words, and [[biological energy|energy source]])\n- A **recipient** for those **electrons** (which is as a rule, highly [[electronegativity|electronegative]])\n- A **source** of [[carbon]] with which they can build their own things\n- A **source** of **other essential** [[nutrients#Micronutrients Vitamins Minerals|miscellaneous molecules]] like N, S, and P to use for building blocks, and Fe and Mg for [[cofactor|cofactors]] for enzymes.\n\nWe can then classify organisms based on those first three traits, and as every organism needs all three aspects, the classifications can and are mixed and matched. The one exception is that phototrophs are almost always autotrophs as well. Classifications can be further refined as well, such as respirators being able to be aerobic or anaerobic.\n\n### Chart\nUses a/n...               | ...as an electron source:   | ...as an electron acceptor:        | ...as a carbon source:\n--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------\n...**organic molecule**...|chemoorganotroph             |[[fermentation\\|fermentator]]       |heterotroph\n...**inorganic molecule**...|[[chemolithotroph]]        |[[cellular respiration\\|respirator]]|autotroph\n...**molecule energized by light**...|phototroph        | (N/A) | (N/A)\n\n## Metabolic Homeostasis\nMetabolism comprises thousands of different chemical reactions, yet the amounts and identities of molecules inside cells are relatively constant. By regulating key reactions involved in catabolic and anabolic pathways, the cell is able to maintain [[homeostasis]] even under different environmental conditions.\n\n## Sugar Can Be Metabolized Into *Any* Amino Acid (But Not By Us)\nTechnically any amino acids that you need you could built from scratch. A lot of [[bacteria]] can do just that that.

A neuron's behavior to neurotransmitters can be modified by a different class of chemical called [[neuromodulators]].\n\nNeurotransmitters are released from the [[synapse|synaptic bulb]] of a neuron into the [[synapse]] where they either bind to the appropriate receptors on the other side of the synapse. Neurotransmitters only bind to their receptors very briefly before bouncing back off again into the synaptic cleft. It is generally the case that the neurotransmitters should not stay in the synaptic cleft for long, and there are a few ways to remove a neurotransmitter form the synapse: reuptake, break down, or diffusion.\n\n**Neurotransmitter reuptake** is when the molecule is absorbed back into the neuron just as it is.\n\nNeurotransmitter break down is facilitated by specialized enzymes that cleave the neurotransmitter. For example, [[acetylcholine|Ach]] is broken down by an enzyme called [[acetylcholine|acetylcholinesterase]], and the component parts are then reabsorbed by the releasing neuron. \n\nNeurotransmitters can also be removed from the synapse by simply diffusing away from it, where there are caught and absorbed by [[glial cells]].\n\n![[neurotransmitter.png]]\n\n\n\n\n\n___\n", "tags": ["Gated"], "links": ["neurons", "neuromodulators", "acetylcholine", "glial cells", "synapse"]}, {"title": "joint", "text": "---\naliases: [articulation, arthrology, fibrous joint, cartilaginous joint,synarthrosis, amphiarthrosis]\ntags: [biology, a&p, joint]\n---\n# Joints\n---\nA **joint**, or **articulation**, is any place where two [[bone|bones]] meet.

The major groove is exactly twice the length of the minor groove, and the reason they are even there has something to do with the angles the nitrogenous bases bind at.\n\n#### Helix-Turn-Helix\nThe advantage of the major groove is that it give space for DNA-binding proteins to latch onto.

Instead of projecting a beam of visible light onto a specimen, the electron microscope uses a beam of [[atom#Electrons Electron Shells|electrons]], which have a much shorter wavelength. Some electron microscopes have a resolution of less than 1.0 nm (0.001 $\\mu$m)\n\n![[electron microscope image.png]]\n\n## Features\n**Lenses** of the electron microscopes are electromagnetic rather than glass as we find in [[light microscope|light microscopes]] (as glass would have little effect on electron beams).\n\nSpecimens must undergo **extensive preparation** prior to observation with this type of microscope. Often, preparations may take a day or more, including fixation (preservation) and gradual dehydration (removal of water).\n\nThere must be strict **climate-control** for them to work, because the specimens seen under an electron microscope must be viewed in a vacuum. This, as well as the size of them mean so the microscopes live in their very own climate-controlled room.\n\nThe pictures taken on electron microscopes are called **microphraphs**. Because electron beams are used instead of light, micrographs are not in color. Colored dyes that enhanced contrast in a light microscope are replaced by chemicals with different electron affinities. While you may occasionally see an electron micrograph that appears to be in color, these have been colorized after they were photographed.\n\n## Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)\nThe **scanning electron microscope** (SEM) projects an electron beam onto the specimen. As electrons bounce off the specimen, they are focused by a series of electromagnetic lenses. Magnifications are typically 200-500,000x, with resolution of 5-10 nm.\n\nThe SEM is most useful in examining surface features of specimens, and provides a three-dimensional image similar to that of the dissecting light microscope, but with greater resolution.\n\nWhole specimens are usually fixed, dehydrated, then coated with gold or other metals inside a vacuum chamber. They are then mounted on a metal cylinder (called a \"stub\") and placed within the specimen chamber of the microscope. After creating a vacuum in the chamber, the electron beam is turned on. \n\n## Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)\nThe **transmission electron microscope** (TEM) projects an electron beam *through* the specimen. It can achieve magnifications up to 1,000,000x and a resolution of less than 1.0 nm.\n\nThe TEM is used to view the internal structures of cells, viruses, and cellular components. The images are two-dimensional.\n\nFor the electrons to penetrate, the specimen must be VERY thin. To produce such specimens, the electron microscopist must first preserve and dehydrate the specimen, then embed it into resin blocks. These blocks are cut into very thin sections (typically 1.0 $\\mu$m or thinner) using a diamond knife within a sectioning device called an ultramicrotome. Sections are collected onto copper grids and are stained with a chemical that has great electron-affinity (to provide contrast). After staining, the grids are placed in the specimen chamber of the TEM, chamber pumped to a vacuum, and the electron beam is projected through the specimen.  \n___", "tags": ["Electrons"], "links": ["light microscope", "microscope"]}, {"title": "BUN", "text": "---\naliases: [blood urea nitrogen]\ntags: []\n---\n# BUN\n---\nA **BUN** level si a lab score that gives a general idea on how your [[kidneys]] are working.

Sensing this loss of pressure the kidneys secrete an enzyme called **[[renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system|renin]]**. Renin eventually makes **[[renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system|angiotensin II]]** out of angiotensin I, which is processed by the liver out of angiotensinogen. But the point is, angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor which works to increase [[blood pressure]].\n\nFurthermore, angiotensin II triggers the release of a different hormone\u2014**[[renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system|aldosterone]]** from the [[adrenal glands]]\u2014which triggers the kidneys to retain [[sodium]] and [[chloride]] ions.

(The end with the carboxylic acid is typically the one that attaches to the [[lipid|glycerol]] head).\n\n## Structure\nThe chain of carbon atoms are bonded all the way down the gain, with a (polar) [[carboxyl group]] group at one end.

Fatty acids with 0 double bonds (and therefore no kinks) are **saturated**, and these are rock hard at room temperature, like bee's wax. Think about how many toothpicks you can fit in a little box...until you start breaking them and leaving them at an angle. \n\n### Unsaturated Fatty Acids\nFatty acids *with* double bonds (and therefore kinks) are **unsaturated** fats.

Unsaturated fatty acids can help with excretion of **[[cholesterol]]**.\n\n#### Mono-Unsaturated & Poly-Unsaturated\n**Monounsaturated fatty acids** (or MUFAs) only have *one* double-bond, while **polyunsaturated fatty acids** (PUFAs) have more than one. \n\n##### Omgegas\nThe last carbon on the chain is called the omega carbon, and so when you have PUFAs you can classify them based on where the first double-bond is relative to the omega carbon.

(The exception of course is for for the stop/start codons, which do not translate to amino acids).\n\n### The Evolutionary Advantage of Redundancy\nCodon redundancy can provide an **[[evolution|evolutionary]] advantage** for organisms that live in different environments. For example, GC base pairs fare better in cold environments than TA pairs on account of their three bonds. For this reason, organisms that are adapted to colder environments evolve to have more GC pairs as they are more resistant to cold than TA pairs. This way, even though two baceria might have much different DNA, but produce the same exact protein.\n\n## Reading Frame\nThe **reading frame** refers to the particular sequence of neucleotides that make up the codon.

There are two different pathways for making bone. **Intramembranous ossification**. which builds up bone from scratch which is how most of the bones in the face and head, as well as the collar bones is created. The rest of the bones are formed from a process called **endochondral ossification** that first builds up a cartilage \"template\" and then gradually replaces the cartilage with bone. \n\n## Intramembranous Ossification\n**Intramembranous ossification** is the process of ossification that builds up bone directly from sheets of [[connective tissue|mesenchymal tissue]]. This pathway makes a relatively few number of bones in the face and head, as well as the collarbones. The process begins *in utero* and does not finish until well after birth. This is why babies have soft skulls. \n\n![[intramembranous ossification.png]]\n\n### Step 1: The Ossification Center\nIntramembranous ossification starts when some cells within the [[connective tissue|mesenchyme]] differentiate into [[bone|osteogenic cells]] (which quickly become [[bone|osteoblasts]]) and cells for forming [[capillaries]]. These cells start out in a cluster called the **ossification center**. \n\n### Step 2: Osteocytes\nThe osteoblasts secrete a protein mixture called **osteoid** which calcifies with (I'm pretty sure anyway) [[bone#Hydroxyapatites|hydroxyapatites]] in it, trapping the osteoblasts in a case of bone. The osteoblasts then transform into [[bone|osteocytes]] and the osteogenic cells turn into new osteoblasts.\n\n### Step 3: Trabecular Matrix & Periosteum\nThe osteoid hardens around the [[capillaries]] which forms the **trabecular matrix** of the spongy bone. Osteoblasts on the outside surface turn into the [[bone#Endosteum Periosteium|periosteum]]. (I'm not sure on this next but, but what it sounds like is:) The osteoblasts of the periosteum then make a casing of dense bone sandwiching the spongy bone.\n\n### Step 4: Bone Marrow\nThe trabecular bone constrains the capillaries so that they eventually smoosh together to form [[bone marrow|red bone marrow]]. \n\n## Endochondral Ossification\n**Endochondral ossification** is one way of ossification where the bone tissue gradually replaces a \"template\" bone made out of [[cartilage]]. [[bone#Classifications|Long bones]] are made this way. It takes a lot longer than [[ossification]], and is used to form the majority of the bones in our body, as well as during [[bone repair]].\n\n![[endochondral ossification.png]]\n\nThis is how most bones are formed. Some others are made though a process called [[ossification]].\n\n### Step 0: The Cartilage Template\nThe bone template is made when [[connective tissue|mesenchymal cells]] differentiate into [[cartilage|chondrocytes]] that form bone-shaped pieces of [[cartilage#Types|hyaline cartilage]]. The [[cartilage|perichondrium]] forms soon after. [[stem cell|Mesenchymal]] cells live under the perichondrium. \n\n### Step 1: Angiogenesis\nAngiogenesis occurs and blood vessels invade the perichondrium.\n\n### Step 2: Osteoblasts Differentiate\nMesenchyme converts to [[bone cells|osteoblasts]].\n\n### Step 3: Periosteal Collar\nThe osteoblasts secrete [[bone cells|osteoid]] to convert the perichondrium to the periosteum. It initially forms as a circle of compact bone around the mostly-still-cartilage diaphysis. This is called the **periosteal collar**.\n\n### Step 4: The Primary Ossification Center\nBefore the matrix can ossify, chondrocytes enlarge and then calcify. As the matrix calcifies the chondrocytes are cut off from a blood supply and die off. This leaves space for more [[capillaries]] to enter the space (which will eventually become the [[bone#Structure|medullary cavity]]) and bring with them [[bone|osteogenic cells]].\nThe **primary ossification center** forms in that growing central cavity of bone tissue. Between the primary ossification center and the periosteal collar there is, for some time, still cartilage remaining. \n\n### Step 5: Secondary Ossification Centers\nAfter birth new **secondary ossification centers** develop at the epiphyses of the long bones in the same way as the primary ossification center does. \n\n### Step 6: Epiphyseal Seals Remain\nThe primary and secondary ossification centers continue to grow and expand until they take up most of the bone, with the exception of the [[long bone|epiphyseal plate]]. This is the site of [[interstitial growth]] during childhood and adolescence. \n___\n\n\n\n\n\n", "tags": ["Structure", "Classifications", "Hydroxyapatites", "Types", "Endosteum"], "links": ["bone repair", "connective tissue", "ossification", "interstitial growth", "capillaries", "bone cells", "cartilage", "bone marrow", "bone", "stem cell", "long bone"]}, {"title": "anatomy & physiology", "text": "---\naliases: [biological organization]\ntags: [a&p]\n---\n# Anatomy & Physiology: Form and Function\n---\n**Anatomy and physiology** are a pair of closely related studies in [[biology]] related to the study of the parts of the human body (anatomy) and their functions (physiology).\n\n[[Anatomy]] is the study of the bits and pieces of the body, their forms and functions; **physiology** is the study of the processes and functions of living things.

Epithelia act as barriers as well as providing structural support. It can also serve as gatekeepers and are selectively permiable regulate the [[membrane transport|transport]] of substances such as water and nutrients. They also function to help with sensations, and secretions as [[#glandular epithelium]]\n\nThe epithelium makes up many of our body's [[tissue membrane|membranes]], such as our [[skin]] (or \"cutanous membrane\"), our [[serous membrane|serous membranes]] and [[mucous membrane|mucous membranes]]. Most of our [[gland|glands]] are made from epithelial tissue, or **glandular epithelium**\n\nEpithelial tissues can change their composition over time in response to external stimuli. For example, if the epithelia in the lungs is repeatedly irritated\u2014for example, from habitual smoking\u2014and the tissue changes to cell types more resistant to irritation. In this example, the normally pseudostratified columnar cells are replaced with stratified squamous cells.\n\n## Characteristics\nEpithelial tissue can be characterized and identified by several characteristics: \n\n- **Cellularity**: They are made almost entirely from tightly packed cells with little to no [[extracellular matrix]]. Cells are connected with [[cell junction|cell junctions]].\n- **Polarity**: Epithelial tissue is anchored to the **[[basement membrane]]** on it's **basal surface**, and the other \"free end\" is called the **apical surface**. Sometimes organelles inside epithelial cells live nearer one side or the other.\n- **Avascularity**: There are no blood vessels in the tissue itself. Only the basal cells directly attached to the basement membrane can get nutrients and oxygen. What happens to the other cells? Well, they die, Jim.\n- **High regeneration**: Cells in epithelial tissue die off relatively quickly, and thus their regeneration rate is quite high. Unfortunately for us this high rate of regeneration makes it a prime spot for [[cancer]] to develop.\n- **Extensive innervation**: With [[nerves]] that allow us to feel things.\n\nIt can be a variety of types depending on its function\u2014such as smooth, or with or [[cilia]] or even [[microvilli]].\n\n## Types of Epithelia\nEpithelia can be divided into two broad categories, *simple* (having only one layer) and *stratified* (having multiple layers). They can then be further broken down by the shapes of cells they have, *squamous* (squished flat), *cuboidal* (square), *columnar* (tall and narrow). There are two special types, pseudostratified and transitional.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n\nA(epithelia)\nB(simple<br>epithelium)\nC(simple<br>squamous)\nD(simple<br>cuboidal)\nE(simple<br>columnar)\nF(ciliated)\nG(nonciliated)\nH(pseudostratified<br>columnar)\nI(stratified<br>epithelium)\nJ(stratified<br>squamous)\nK(keratinized)\nL(nonkeratinized)\nM(statified<br>cuboidal)\nN(stratified<br>columnar)\nO(transitional)\n\nA ===> B & I\nB --> C & D & E & H\nE --> F & G\nI --> J & M & N & O\nJ --> K & L\n\n```\n\n### Simple Epithelia\n**Simple epithelia** have one single layer of cells, all of which are attached to the [[basement membrane]]. They come in *simple squamous*, *simple cuboidal* and *simple columnar*, with a bonus of *pseustratified columnar*\n\n#### Simple Squamous\n**Simple squamous epithelia** are about as thin as you can get, and are perfect for very fast materials exchange, i.e. filtration, absorption, excretion, gas exchange. For this reason they are found in places like the [[lungs|alveoli]], and in the lumen of blood vessels.\n\n![[simple squamous.png]]\n \nSome simple squamous tissues have specific names based on where they are located. The **mesothelium** is the name of the simple squamous tissue that forms [[serous membrane|serous membranes]]. The **endothelium** is the simple squamous tissue that lines the insides of [[blood]] and [[lymphatic system]] vessels.\n\n#### Simple Cuboidal\n**Simple cuboidal epithelia** are pretty straightforward: they're a row of boxy cells that are used for absorption and secretion. They form most of the [[#Glandular Epithelium|glands]] and small ducts of the body, and the walls of the [[kidneys]].\n\n![[simple cuboidal.png]]\n\n#### Simple Columnar\n**Simple columnar epithelia** are taller than they are wide, and can be divided into *ciliated* and *nonciliated* versions. Both versions may or may not have [[goblet cell|goblet cells]]. \n\n**Ciliated simple columnar epithelium** have [[cilia]], and function not only to secrete [[goblet cell|mucin]], but to move mucous but also things like eggs through the [[uterine tubes]].\n\n![[ciliated simple columnar.png]]\n\n**Nonciliated simple columnar epithelium** do not have cilia but they usually have [[microvilli]], or a brush boarder. They live in the intestines and function to secrete [[goblet cell|mucin]] and help absorb nutrients as [[enterocytes]].\n\n![[nonciliated simple columnar.png]]\n\n#### Pseudostratified Columnar\n**Pseudostratified columnar epithelia** may appear at first glance as if they were stratified columnar, but in fact they are simple\u2014each cell does attach to the basement membrane, but does not necessarily reach the apical surface. It can be difficult to tell especially because the neuclei are all at various levels. It serves a protective function, and like simple columnar, it comes in ciliated and nonciliated forms, but unlike simple columnar, only the ciliated version has [[goblet cell|goblet cells]].\n\n**Ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium** serves as protection and the secretion of mucin to move debris out of the respiratory tract.\n\n![[ciliated pseudostratified.png]]\n\n**Nonciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium** is quite rare, and does not produce mucin. It's only found lining part of the male urethra and epididymis. \n\n![[nonciliated pseudostratified.png]]\n\n### Stratified Epithelium\n**Stratified epithelium** is epithelial tissue that comes in multiple layers, only the very bottom of which reach the basement membrane. Because epithelium is avascular, only the cell on the basemement membrane have access to nutrients. As time goes on new cells grow off the basemement membrane and push the older cells toward the surface, cutting them off of their nutrient access, basically setting a countdown to cell death. Because of this though, its much heartier than simple epithelium, and can afford to loose a layer or two due to abrasion with no real negative effects.\n\n#### Stratified Squamous\n**Stratified squamous epithelium** have squamous cells on the apical layers but do actually start out cuboidal or polyhedral near the basement membrane. They get squished as they move further and further out. This type comes in two forms, *keratinized* and *nonkeratinized*.\n\n**Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium** is found in the [[epidermis]] and produces [[keratinocytes|keratin]], which hardens the cell, but also kills it. The very outer layers of this type of tissue are all dead from keratin by the time they get there. The keratin also replaces the nucleus and organelles.\n\n![[keratinized stratified squamous.png]]\n\n**Nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium** do not produce keratin, but are still useful in protecting the underlying tissue from abbrasion, in places like the esophagous, vagina and anus. Without keratin the cells on the apical layer are still alive (with a visable nucleus), and kept moist with secretions such as saliva and mucous. It's found in the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, vagina and anus.\n\n![[nonkeratinized stratified squamous.png]]\n\n#### Stratified Cuboidal\n**Stratified cuboidal epithelium** has multiple layers of cuboidal cells, and much like simple cuboidal is used mosltly in [[#glandular epithelium]], forming the [[exocrine gland|ducts]] of larger glands such as [[sweat glands]].\n\n![[stratified cuboidal.png]]\n\n#### Stratified Columnar\n**Stratified solumnar epithelium** is rather rare, and is made up of multiple layers of cells, but only the apical layer is cuboidal\u2014the others are cuboidal. It's found in the salivary glands, the conjuctiva of the eye and the male urethra.\n\n![[stratified columnar.png]]\n\n#### Transitional Epithelium\n**Transitional epithelium** is a special kind of epithelial tissue that is found in the urinary bladders, the ureters and the urethrea. It has the ability to change shape in order to stretch out (when full) and shrink back down again (when empty). In its relaxed state its cells are cuboidal or polyhedral, and the apical cells are rounded like Squidward's head. In its distended state the cells appear cuboidal and the apical cells are squamous-like. Some of the cells are binucleated.\n\n![[transitional epithelium.png]]\n___", "tags": ["Glandular", "glandular"], "links": ["keratinocytes", "microvilli", "lymphatic system", "uterine tubes", "serous membrane", "tissue membrane", "cilia", "blood", "nerves", "enterocytes", "tissue", "cancer", "skin", "basement membrane", "lungs", "sweat glands", "kidneys", "epidermis", "extracellular matrix", "mucous membrane", "exocrine gland", "goblet cell", "membrane transport", "gland", "cell junction"]}, {"title": "influential nurses", "text": "---\naliases: [Florence Nightingale, Clara Barton, Dorothea Dix, Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Linda Richards, Mary Mahoney, Lavinia Dock, Isabel Hampton-Robb, Mary Adelaide Nutting, Lilian Wald, Margaret Sanger, Virginia Henderson, Mildred Montag, Luther Christman, Suzie Walking Bear Yellowtail, Madeline Leininger, Kris Swanson, Patricia Benner]\ntags: [nursing]\n---\n# Influential Nurses\n---\nOver the course of history there have been many [[nursing|nurses]] that have been highly influential to the field.\n\n## Florence Nightingale\n**Florence Nightingale** is the founder of nursing as profession.

She was so good at her job that during the Crimean war she was called upon to serve at a field hospital (Scutari) to take care of the wounded soldiers who were dying to great rates due to [[infection]] and disease. She and her team of nurses organized and improved the quality of sanitation at the hospital, and reduced the mortality rate from 42.7% to 2.2% in 6 months.\n\nAfter the war, she took all the [[statistics|data she had collected]] and convinced those in the medical profession that there was a need for killed, trained nurses in hospitals.

After the war she began the **American Red Cross**\n\n## Dorothea Dix\n**Dorothea Dix** did a lot of work with the mentally ill. She set up field hospitals during the American Civil War.\n\n## Harriet Tubman\n**Harriet Tubman** who escaped slavery and then went back and helped a whole bunch of other people escape slavery as well. She worked as a nurse during the American Civil War, among other things\u2014her civil war pension described her role as \"nurse, spy, cook\". \n\n## Sojourner Truth\n**Sojourner Truth** cared for Black soldiers during the American Civil War.\n\n## Linda Richards\n**Linda Richards** was the first trained American nurse. (There were schools set up after the American Civil War, and I guess she went to one?) She did also founded a lot of schools in the US and Japan.\n\nShe was the first person to set up a system for keeping individual medical records for hospitals.\n\n## Mary Mahoney\n**Mary Mahoney** was the first Black nurse to graduate in the US. She cofounded the Association of Colored Graduate Nurses, which thrived with many years before merging with the ANA.\n\n## Lavinia Dock\n**Lavinia Dock** was a nurse, an activist and a suffragette. She was an educator at the John Hopkins School of Nursing, and became the superintendent of nurses there.\n\n## Isabel Hampton-Robb\n**Isabel Hampton-Robb** was the first president of the ANA, and she founded the National League of Nurses. She was a big proponent for nursing students to have competencies, and to have nursing schools have relationships with hospitals.\n\n## Mary Adelaide Nutting\n**Mary Adelaide Nutting** was the first professor of nursing. There had been superintendents but up to that point there hadn't been any professors. She also set up the first 3 year school for nursing. She was the second president of the ANA, after Hampton-Robb\n\n## Lilian Wald\n**Lilian Wald** is considered a champion of the urban poor. She was an activist and started formal public health nursing. During this time you didn't go to the hospital unless you were really dying, and sometimes not even then.\n\nShe also convinced the New York Board of Education to hire on a nurse, which led to having nurses in public schools.\n\n## Margaret Sanger\n**Margaret Sanger** was an activist who started the birth control movement. This was during the 1920's when the Comstock Act was a federal law that prohibited birth control (among other things). She opened the first birth control clinic and founded the organization that would become Planned Parenthood. One important note to mention is that she did buy pretty hard into eugenics, which is rather problematic as some of the ramifications of those ideologies are still felt today.\n\n## Virginia Henderson\n**Virginia Henderson** is an educator, author, researcher and nurse theorist who is considered on par with Florence Nightingale for her contributions for nursing. She really believed that everyone should take care of themselves as much as possible. She wrote many many textbooks, and also shifted [[nursing research]] from looking at nurses to looking at the act of nursing itself.\n\n>[!quote] What is nursing?\n>The unique function of the nurse is to assist the individual, sick or well, in the performance of those activities contributing to health or its recovery (or to peaceful death) that he would perform unaided if he had the necessary **strength**, **will** or **knowledge**.\n>\u2014Virginia Henderson\n\n## Mildred Montag\n**Mildred Montag**, PhD, was a nurse educator who founded nursing programs to address the nursing shortage during WWII. She set up 2-year, curriculum-based (as opposed to hospital-based) trained nurses under the Nurse Training Act, many of whom would go on to serve in the Nurse Cadet Corp. She advocated for setting up associate degrees for nursing.\n\n## Luther Christman\n**Luther Christman** was a Dean at Rush University, and was a big advocate for having advanced nurse practice roles and having gender and racial diversity in nursing. He was a nurse during a time where that was quite uncommon, and co-founded the American Association of Men in Nursing.\n\n## Suzie Walking Bear Yellowtail\n**Suzie Walking Bear Yellowtail** was one of the first Native Americans (and the first Crow) to graduate as an RN in the US. She worked with the Indian Health Service to bring health care to native people.

The juxtamedullary nephrons, with their long nephron loops, do the work of maintaining this steep gradient, thanks to the countercurrent multiplier.\n\n### Countercurrent Exchanger\nThe **countercurrent exchanger** uses the opposite flow **between the [[renal tubule|nephron loop]] and the vasa recta to maintain the medullary osmolarity gradient** by making sure reabsorbed water does not accumulate in the interstitial space, and solutes are not simply washed away by the [[nephron|peritubular capillaries]].\n\n\nWater leaving (i.e. being reabsorbed by) the descending loop of Henle is picked right up by the vasa recta; likewise, salt ions leaving (i.e. being reabsorbed by) the ascending loop of Henle are also picked right up by the vasa recta.\n\nSolutes are in constant transport, so even though it gets picked back up pretty much right away, they're still in the interstitial *en route*, so the concentration gradient is maintained.\n\n## Urea Recycling\n**Urea recycling** is a method of maintaining the osmolarity gradient by using the waste product [[urea]] as a medullary solute before letting it be sent down the collecting duct. Although ultimately urea is [[tubular secretion]], this also lets urea be concentrated in the urine to a really high level\u2014essentially using a countercurrent multiplier. If it could do this it would not be able to concentrate itself too high, and we would need to produce a *lot* more urine to get rid of it all, because we produce a ton of urea.

[[disease|Illness]] and injury of either oneself or one's family member is a significant cause of stress for many people; and stress\u2014especially [[chronic stress]]\u2014can lead to health problems of it's own.\n\n[[Allostasis]] is a state of psychological balance, which is the \"goal state\" for people undergoing stress. To return to allostasis people employ a variety of [[coping mechanism|coping mechanisms]], some of which are more helpful or mature than others.\n\n![[reaction to stressor.png]]\n\n## Types of Stress\nThere are different types of stress, depending largely on circumstance and also how it is perceived by the individual.\n\n- **Eustress** is a term for a type of low-level stress that is well managed and actually has beneficial effects. It has less to do with the actual stressor. Has productive and adaptive functions, and your senses are heightened, you can probably deal with it\n- **Distress** negative stress, that may overwhelm coping strategies.\n\t- **Acute stress** overwhelming stress that is very immediate. Homeostasis may be returned if the\n\t- [[Chronic stress]] is stress that builds up over time. It can have an accumulative wear and tear effect ([[allostasis|allostatic load]]) that can be quite damaging.\n\n## Stress Frameworks\nThere are several frameworks that are useful when discussing how we react to stress.\n\n### **Systemic Physiological Response**\n**Systemic physiological response** is a framework that describes stress a physiological response to a stressor, weather it is an actual threat or only a perceived threat. Stress is a disruption to your state of [[homeostasis]], because it activates your [[sympathetic nervous system|fight or flight]] response. Basically it's a \"one size fits all\" reaction to a threat.\n\nThis framework has been around since the 1930s.\n\n### General Adaptation Syndrome\n**General adaptation syndrome** is a framework that describes stress in a pattern consisting of three stages. It expands upon the systemic physiological response.\n\nThe first stage is the **alarm reaction**, which happens quite quickly after the threat occurs\u2014minutes to hours. This is our [[sympathetic nervous system|fight or flight]] response\n\nThe second stage is the **stage of resistance**. If the stressors continue, the body's systems *try to return to normal* and reverse the physiological changes. Depending on the stressor, the body *may* regain [[homeostasis]], or may not. If the stressor is [[chronic stress|prolonged]] or overwhelms the body's capacity to over come (such as excessive bleeding, a major illness, or a heart attack) then the adaptive mechanisms become exhausted.\n\nThe final stage is the **stage of exhaustion** where the adaptive mechanisms are now now longer able to provide defense. The body has no other choice but to rest and try to return to homeostasis, or it will die.\n\n![[general adaptation system.png]]\n___\n\n#flashcard\nwhat are the three frameworks for thinking about stress?\n::\nsystemic physiological response\ngeneral adaptation syndrome\nallostasis\n<!--SR:!2022-12-20,10,204-->\n\nwhat are the three steps of the General Adaptation Syndrome?\n::\n- alarm reaction\n- stage of resistance\n- stage of exhaustion\n<!--SR:!2022-12-17,7,170-->\n\n___", "tags": ["flashcard"], "links": ["homeostasis", "sympathetic nervous system", "chronic stress", "disease", "coping mechanism", "allostasis"]}, {"title": "glycogen", "text": "---\naliases: [glycogenesis, glycogenolysis]\ntags: [biology, nutrition]\n---\n# Glycogen\n---\n**Glycogen** is a polymer of [[glucose]] that we like a lot.

All monosaccharides travel to the liver once they are digested, and if we actually have enough glucose in our bloodstream, then the liver starts complexing the glycogen. Glycogen can also be stored in the [[muscle tissue]].\n\n![[glycogen.png]]\n\nSome glycogen is stored in the [[liver]] (~100g), but for a lot more is actually stored in the [[muscle tissue]] itself (~500g).\n\nThe body typically has enough glycogen stored to last about 1-2 days, after which, if needed it can take energy from fats in [[adipose tissue|adipose cells]] or [[muscle tissue]], or by converting proteins or other materials into glucose.\n\nThe total amount of glycogen in the muscle is nearly always 2 to 3 times greater than the amount in the liver.\n\n## Glycogenesis & Glycogenolysis\n**Glycogenesis** is the creation of glycogen. It is made out of [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate|glyceraldehyde phosphate]], an intermediate of glycolysis.

If oxygen is not present, the ETC backs up and cannot generate the proton gradient that it needs to generate the ATP. Fortunately some organisms can resort to fermentation that can generate just a little bit of ATP to keep going for a little while.\n\n## Obligate & Facultative\nIf an organism relies exclusively on fermentation to live, it is considered an [[aerobic and anaerobic#Types|obligate anaerobe]]. \n\n\"[[aerobic and anaerobic#Types|facultative anaerobes]]\" can switch between fermentation and cellular respiration.\n\n(For a full breakdown on the different levels of oxygen requirements/tolerance, see [[aerobic and anaerobic#Types|this chart]].)\n\nIn humans, the only reason why regular cells will swap to fermentation if our final electron acceptor, oxygen, in the [[ETC (mitochondria)|ETC]] is missing.\n\n## Process\nIf fermentation kicks in, [[NAD|NADH]] is recycled back into [[NAD|NAD+]]. Since the first part of [[glycolysis]] depends on reducing NADH from NAD+ in order to make it's meagre 2 [[ATP]], if we don't get that NAD+ from somewhere [[glycolysis]] stops completely. Without the presence of NAD+, there is nowhere for the electrons produced from the reactions to go, and everything will back up.\n\nFermentation allows the process to regenerate NAD+ and allow it to continue to produce pyruvate and ATP. (In humans) pyruvate acts as the substrate for fermentation, which reduces into lactate. \n\n## Types of Fermentation \nThere are many different types of fermentation that different cells can do. They are all named after the waste byproduct that they produce, but the significant difference is in what they use as their *final electron acceptor*. \n\n### Lactic Acid Fermentation\n**Lactic acid fermentation** is fermentation that uses straight up [[pyruvate]] as a final electron acceptor. The byproduct of this form of fermentation is [[lactate]], or \"lactic acid\". Humans use this form of fermentation in our [[muscle tissue]] when we can't pump enough oxygen there, such as during intense exercise.  [[Bacteria]] can also do this type of fermentation, which we use to help us to do things like curdle milk to make yogurt.\n\n![[lactic acid fermentation.png]]\n\n### Ethanol Fermentation\n**Ethanol fermentation** is fermentation that uses acetaldehyde as a final electron acceptor. Acetaldehyde is a modified form of [[pyruvate]] where one carbon has been removed as CO$_2$. When that acetaldehyde is reduced, it becomes ethanol. We use bacteria who can do ethanol fermentation for things like bread or beer.\n\n![[alcohol fermentation.png]]\n\n### Butanediol Fermentation\n**Butanediol fermentation** is fermentation that uses acetoin as a final electron acceptor. Acetoin is made by removing one CO$_2$ each from two different [[pyruvate|pyruvates]] and then combining those two molecules into a four carbon molecule. When acetion is reduced it becomes butanediol.\n\n### Mixed Acid Fermentation\n**Mixed acid fermentation** is fermentation that uses [[isomer|isomerized]] version of [[pyruvate]] as the final electron acceptor.

All energy is in one of two basic states of energy, **kinetic** and **potential**. Kinetic energy is active, moving energy, while potential is latent or stored energy.

Simply put, *it is energy that is free to do useful work in the system*. It is *not* the total energy change of a chemical reaction. \n\nFree energy is written as \"G\" in reactions. The change in free energy is written as \u0394G, and generally in J/mol. \u0394G can be calculated, but not measured. For example, for the reaction A \u2014> B:\n\n$$\u0394G = G_B - G_A $$\n\n## Endergonic vs Exergonic\n**Endergonic** and **exergonic** are ways to describe [[endergonic and exergonic|different classifications]] of chemical reactions that describe to what happens to free energy during the reaction reaction.\n\n## Biological Energy\n**Energy** is a vital component in [[biological energy|biology]].

But CTE and concussion are separate conditions.\n\nMany people who are concussed do not go on to develop CTE, but evidence suggests a pattern of repeated minor head injuries increases the risk.\n\nThe only way to prevent CTE is to avoid repetitive head injuries.

The method used to measure the strength of an acid or base is called the **[[pH]] scale**, which goes from 0-14. The lower the number the more acidic it is, 7 is neutral, and then the higher the number thee more basic it is. Acids and bases are always in [[solution]] (I'm pretty sure).\n\n## The Arrhenius Theory\nThe **Arrhenius theory** was the first theory about what makes an acid and acid, and what makes a base a base. This theory states that acids and bases can be identified by the ions that it has in solution. If it has hydrogen ions, then it is an acid, and if it has hydroxide ions, then it is a base.\n\n## The Br\u00f8nstead-Lowry Theory\nThe **Br\u00f8nstead-Lowry** theory describes acid-base interactions in terms of [[hydrogen ion|proton]] transfer between chemicals. This theory expands upon the Arrhenius theory. A Br\u00f8nstead-Lowry acid *donates* an H+ into solution when they are dissolved, and conversely, a Br\u00f8nstead-Lowry base *accepts* the H+ in solution when they are dissolved.\n\nIn this theory, water can be both an acid or a base, depending.\n\n### Conjugate Pairs\nIn the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases, a conjugate acid-base pair consists of two substances that differ only by the presence of a proton (H\u207a). A conjugate acid is formed when a proton is added to a base, and a conjugate base is formed when a proton is removed from an acid.\n\n![[conjugate pair.png]]\n\n**Titration** is the process of canceling out an acid or base by adding in some of it's conjugate.\n\n## The Lewis Theory\nThe **Lewis** theory describes acid-base interactions in terms of the transfer between electron pairs. This theory builds on the Br\u00f8nstead-Lowry theory, and is even more broad, extending into solids and gasses.\n\nA **Lewis acid** is a substance that *accepts* a pair of electrons to form a covalent bond.\n\nA **Lewis base** is a substance that *donates* a pair of electrons to form a covelent bond. \n\n## Strong & Weak Acids & Bases\nStrong acids and strong bases dissociate completely in [[solution]]; weak acids and weak bases do not.

Buffer solutions resist a change in pH when small amounts of a strong acid or a strong base are added.\n\nNote, you cannot mix any two acid/base combination together and get a buffer, both the acid and the base component must be *part of the same equilibrium system*.\n\nSingle molecules can also act as buffers by binding ty hydrogen or hydroxyl ions. [[protein|Proteins]] act as buffers because they have both the basic amine group and the acidic carboxyl group on them. \n\nOur blood and cells are filled with [[blood buffer systems|buffers]] or weak acids to help maintain physiological [[acid-base balance|pH]]. \n\n![[acid and base concentrations.png]]\n\n## Hydronium and Hydroxide\n**Hydronium** is the word for H$_3$O+ is called **hydronium** and OH- is called **hydroxide**. Another way of thinking about acids and bases is as a ratio of hydronium and hydroxide. Distilled [[water]] is at an equilibiram between a hydronium and a hydroxide. Hydrogen ions are spontaneously generated in pure water by the dissociation (ionization) of a small percentage of water molecules into equal numbers of hydrogen (H+) ions and hydroxide (OH\u2013) ions. \n\n## Acids and Bases in Biology\nIn [[biology]], keeping [[hydrogen ion|H+]] levels within a narrow range is critically important. This is called the [[acid-base balance]], and deviating from it can be harmful. \n\nAcidic foods taste better, because we have acid in our [[stomach]] (pH=2). So, eating it works well with the digestive system. Bases would counteract our stomach. After the stomach though, our digestive system is mostly neutral.\n\nHuman [[blood]] is a little bit basic (much like [[evolution|seawater]]...).

The primary curvatures arch anteriorly and the secondary curvatures are *compensation curvatures* which arch posteriorly. \n\n### Abnormal Curvatures\n**Kyphosis** is an exaggerated thoracic curvature\u2014i.e. a \"hunchback\". This is a condition that may result from [[osteoporosis]]\n\n**Lordosis** is an exaggerated lumbar curvature\u2014i.e. a \"swayback\".

Pigments do not function individually, but rather in large groups or complexes called [[photosystem|photosystems]].\n\n## Structure\nPigments have a head region and a [[fatty acids|fatty acid]] tail region, which allows them to anchor into membranes. Many pigments also have a [[element#Metals|metal]] ion.\n\n### Conjugated System\n**Conjugated systems** are systems of connected molecular orbitals with delocalized electrons. These are useful because they lower the overall energy of the molecules, and decrease the energy gaps between molecular orbitals. Conjugated systems are identified by the presence of alternating single and multiple bonds and lone pairs of electrons.\n\n## Process\nWhen a photon with just the right wavelength strikes the [[pigment|pigments]] in the chloroplasts, it is absorbed by the head region of the molecule. The photon's energy excites an [[atom|electron]]. This means the electron has high potential energy, but needs to be used quickly or it will dissipate. Excited electrons can do one of four things:\n1. Fall back down and emit energy as fluorescence...\n2. ..\\.and/or heat.\n3. Transfer its energy through [[photosystem|resonance energy transfer]].\n4. Be transferred to an electron acceptor if the pigment is a photosystem's [[photosystem|reaction center]].\n\n## Location in the Chloroplasts\nThe pigment molecules are held in place by the [[photosystem]] they are associated with. Proper positioning of them is essential.\n\n## Types\n**Chlorophyll** is a pigment that absorbs blue and red wavelengths of light, thus giving it a green color. There are two types, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b.\n\n**Carotenoid** is an accessary pigment that absorbs blue and green wavelengths of light, thus appears yellow, orange or red. During [[photosynthesis]], carotenoids extend the range of light that photosystems can absorb, while also protecting the other pigments by absorbing some dangerous ultraviolet light.\n\n**Pheophytin** is structurally very similar to chlorophyll, except it lacks the magnesium in the head region.\n\n**Bacteriochlorophyll** is a pigment found in various purple or green bacteria.\n\n**Rhodopsin** (also knowns as \"visual purple\") is a pigment that is found in the rods in an animal's [[eyes|retina]]. This protein comes from \"bacteriorhodopsins\" who used this protein eons ago to detect light.\n\nThere is a theory that [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] plants do not use the middle portions of the spectrum because they evolved underneath the bacteriorhopsins, which used that part of the spectrum.

Neurons have different jobs, depending on what types of signals they carry. [[peripheral nervous system|Sensory neurons]] carry sensory information for the PNS\n\nNeurons activate when a certain threshold of stimuli is met, triggering an [[action potential]] that sends a chain reaction all the way to the other end of the system.\n\n![[neuron.png]]\n\n## Neuron Structure\nThe neuron has a distinctive structure of three parts, the main cell body, the axon and the dendrites. Different neurons have different features, but there are some similarities across all neurons\n\nThe **cell body** or **soma** is the central portion of the cell where most of the inner workings live\u2014such as the cytoplasm, nucleus, and organelles.\n\nThe **dendrites** are the branch-like arms that reach out from the main body.\n\nThe **axon** is the long, slender tail-like piece of the neuron. The nerve impulses move along the axon, away from the body of the cell. Axons are often bundled units that function together. In the [[central nervous system|CNS]] they are called \"tracts\" and in the [[peripheral nervous system|PNS]] they are called \"[[nerves]]\". At the end of the axon there are processes called **axonal terminals** which have sac-like endings called **synaptic bulb**\u2014which is what releases neurotransmitters into the [[synapse]].\n\nBetween the soma and the axon is the **axon hillock**.\n\nSome tracts or nerves are protected and electrically insulated by a [[myelination]]. But even those that are are not myelinated down the whole length. There are gaps where the \n\n## Types\nNeurons come in one of four types of basic configurations: multipolar, bipolar, pseudo-bipolar and anaxonic. **Multipolar** neurons have many dendrites that extend the [[cell|soma]] off of the soma, and a single prominent axon. **Bipolar** neurons have a single dendrite and a single axon. Lastly there are **anoxonic** neurons. \n\n![[basic neurons.png]]\n## Axonal Transport\nNeurons can transport materials along its axion in either direction, but the means are quite different.\n\n- **Anterograde transport** is transport along the axon starting in the soma and moving towards the axonal terminals. This type of transport is very important as the soma is where all the [[ribosome|ribosomes]] are that can make the substances that are released in the synaptic bulbs.\n\n- **Retrograde transport** is transport along the axon starting at the axonal terminals and moving towards the terminals. For example, broken down neurotransmitters that have been [[neurotransmitter|reabsorbed]] are sent back to the soma by retrograde transport. There is also an ability of neurons to send retrograde messages this way.\n\n- **Fast axonal transport** can go in either direction, and it is facilitated by [[microtubules]]\n\n>[!health] Rabies!\n>The [[rabies]] virus reaches your central nervous system via a cut anywhere on your body by hitching a ride on the axonal transport of your neurons. \n\n## Neural Action Potentials\nThe neuron's main job is to send [[action potential|action potentials]]. Like action potentials vary from type-of-cell to type-of-cell, so to do they vary from neuron to neuron. However, there are some overall similarities we can describe.\n\nThe graph of a neural action potential follows the standard graph pretty closely. The [[resting membrane potential|RMP]] is generally around -70mv and the [[action potential|threshold potential]] is around -55mv. At the peak of depolarization the [[membrane potential]] reaches about +30mv before repolarization begins. The action potential is triggered when the neuron receives enough [[graded potential#EPSPs|EPSPs]] to a) counter any [[graded potential#IPSPs|IPSPs]] and b) reach the threshold potential.\n\n![[action potential - neuron.png]]\n\n### Conduction of Action Potentials\nThe neuron is divided into four main sections with regards to action potentials: the **receptive segment**, the **initial segment**, the **conductive segment** and the **transmissive segment**\n\nThe **receptive segment** is made up of the soma and the dendrites. This segment forms many [[synapse|synapses]] from one or more other neurons. In the plasma membrane there are specially [[channel proteins|chemically-gated channels]] that bind to different [[neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]], that allow in or out [[sodium|Na+]], [[potassium|K+]], or [[chloride|Cl-]] ions in order to generate [[graded potential#IPSPs|IPSPs]] or [[graded potential#EPSPs|EPSPs]], depending. Action potentials are not generated here because there are no *voltage*-gated sodium channels.\n\nThe **initial segment** is the axon hillock, and this is where IPSPs and EPSPs total together and if the EPSPs are strong enough, trigger the [[action potential]].\n\nThe **conductive segment** is the axon, where the action potentials [[action potential#Conduction|conduct]] all the way down to the axonal terminals and finish at the synaptic bulbs. Unmyelinated axions perform the slow and steady [[action potential#Conduction|continuous conduction]], but [[myelination|myelinated]] axons can perform the faster, jumpier [[saltatory conduction]].\n\nThe **transmissive segment** is the synaptic bulbs. \n\n![[neuron pumps and channels.png]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___\n", "tags": ["EPSPs", "IPSPs", "Conduction"], "links": ["peripheral nervous system", "myelination", "sodium", "neural tissue", "chloride", "potassium", "channel proteins", "ribosome", "synapse", "central nervous system", "cell", "action potential", "neurotransmitter", "membrane potential", "microtubules", "resting membrane potential", "nerves", "rabies"]}, {"title": "nose and sinus assessment", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [nursing]\n---\n# nose and sinus assessment\n---\n**nose and sinus assessment** [[nose]] [[paranasal sinuses]]\n\n## Subjective\n- any loss of smell\n- do you have a diveated septum\n- any discharge\n- frequent colds\n- sinus pain\n- trauma\n- epistaxis (nosebleeds)\n- allergies\n\n## Objective\nYou're going to need gloves, a penlight, a cotton 4x4.

They can also be used for energy if necessary, but are not really a good source for that. Dietary protein is also one of the main sources of [[nitrogen balance|nitrogen]].\n\nAnother function of proteins is that they drive almost every chemical reaction in the body in the form of [[enzyme|enzymes]].\n\nProteins can also serve as [[blood buffer systems|buffers]], as they have a positive charge and a negative charge end that can accept or donate a [[hydrogen ion|H+]].\n\n[^1]: The word \"polypeptide\" is used to describe amino acids that are joined together with peptide bonds. Though they are often used to refer to a protein, (or at least the primary structure of a protein) they are *technically* different...but for our purposes here it's fine.\n\n## Structure\nProtein structure is very complex and specific, one change and the function of the whole protein can be drastically hindered or even halted altogether.\n\n### Backbone & Sidechain\nThe two general \"regions\" of a polypeptide chain is the **backbone** and the **side chains**. The backbone is comprised of the non-sidechain portion of the constituent [[amino acids#Structure|amino acids]] chained end to end by special covalent bonds called *[[covalent bond#Peptide Bond|peptide bonds]]*\n\n![[protein backbone.png]]\n\nThe sidechain, or the R-groups, are the unique portions of the amino acids that give them their unique properties. I imagine proteins with their side chains dangling off as a sort of Incan quipu (an apt metaphor in more ways than one).\n\n### Primary, Secondary, Tertiary & Quaternary Structures\nProteins have a very complex, three to four-part **[[protein structure|structure]]** that is broken down in to their primary, secondary, tertiary and sometimes even quaternary structures. \n\n [[Protein folding]] is an incredibly important and complex process and it involves all of the structures.\n\n## Protein Metabolism\nDietary proteins are [[protein digestion|digested]] after being eaten, and absorbed into the system as individual [[amino acids]].\n\nOnce in the system, proteins can be broken back down into amino acids that can be further [[deamination|broken down]] for energy or even [[transamination|converted]] into other non-essential amino acids.\n\n**[[Protein turnover]]** is the constant cycle of breaking down and building up of new proteins.\n\nMaking new proteins with free amino acids is called **[[translation]]**.\n\n## Conservation of Structure Through Evolution\nProteins have a highly complex, yet highly conserved structure, from the order of the amino acids to the coming together of multiple proteins into a single unit. \n\nDespite the *potential* for an *astronomical* number of proteins, given the combinations of amino acids possible, there are actually a small number of proteins that exist. Their function has been conserved and maintained for so long, and when you get down to it, there are only so many shapes they can take on. There are only like, 1600 protein structures that have ever been discovered (and dispite the massive amount of research, we've stopped finding new ones around 2008). They are modified to do different things for different organisms, but they are essentially the same ones used over and over again.\n\n\n\n\n\n%% This space intentionally left blank%%", "tags": ["Peptide", "Structure"], "links": ["protein structure", "antibody", "muscle tissue", "transamination", "nutrients", "blood buffer systems", "amino acids", "macromolecules", "enzyme", "hydrogen ion", "protein digestion", "translation", "nitrogen balance", "metabolism", "deamination"]}, {"title": "iron", "text": "---\naliases: [ferrious iron, ferric iron, myglobin, heme, hemochromatosis, ferroportin, transferrin, ferritin, hemosiderin, Fe2+, Fe3+]\ntags: [biology, nutrition]\n---\n# Iron\n---\n**Iron** is a trace [[mineral]] that is an essential component of many proteins, including enzymes and those involved in energy production.\n\nIt is unique as it has a positive charge, and yet can easily [[redox|give up or gain an electron]], switching from Fe$^{2+}$ (ferrous iron) to Fe$^{3+}$ (ferric iron)\n\n## Heme\nA **heme** group is an organic molecule that can \"host\" an iron ion in the middle of it, that can act as a shuttle for oxygen molecules.

It consists of four sub-proteins that each have a heme group.\n\n**Myoglobin** is mainly found in the [[muscle tissue]] where it acts as a storage place for oxygen within the muscles.\n\n## Iron Transport\nIron is [[membrane transport|transported]] across them membranes of [[enterocytes]] as Fe$^{2+}$ by a transmembrane protein called **ferroportin**, where it enters the [[body fluids|interstitial fluid]] and then regular circulation. In the blood it's converted into Fe$^{3+}$ and bound to a transport protein called **transferrin**, where it is circulated to the cells of the body. \n\n## Iron Storage\nSmall amounts of iron can be stored in the forms of **ferritin** and **hemosiderin**. \n\n## Hemochromatosis\n**Hemochromatosis** is a [[genetic disorder]] that is characterized by increased absorption of dietary iron and altered iron storage. Because iron regulation does not include eliminating high amounts of iron, this can cause an iron buildup. This can build up in organs causing damage, or stimulate oxidative damage by promoting [[antioxidant|free radicals]]. \n\n## Iron Deficiency\n**[[Iron deficiency]]** can be due to poor dietary intake of iron or excessive loss of it.

Each of the lobules (which are about marble-sized) also surrounded by their own bit of connective tissue, and correspond to a [[bronchi|terminal bronchiole]].\n\n![[lung segments.png]]\n\n## Regulatory Functions of the Lungs\nThe lungs serve and important regulatory function in maintaining the [[acid-base balance]]. Because CO$_2$ in the blood causes it to become [[acids and bases|acidic]] then by adjusting the speed and depth of breath the lungs can cantribute to retaining or expelling CO$_2$ accordingly. \n\nThe lungs help in [[thermoregulation]] because the hot air leaves the body and cool air comes in. So much so that if you've been asleep and you have a bit of a fever, taking a few deep breaths can actually cool you down.\n\n## Diseases of the Lungs\n[[emphysema]]\n[[asthma]]\n[[COPD]]\n___\n", "tags": [], "links": ["thermoregulation", "breathing", "pleura", "organ", "emphysema", "asthma", "COPD", "lung sounds", "bronchi", "incentive spirometer", "acid-base balance", "acids and bases", "thoracic cavity"]}, {"title": "epinephrine and norepinephrine", "text": "---\naliases: [epinephrine, norepinephrine]\ntags: []\n---\n# Epinephrine & Norepinephrine\n---\n**Epinephrine** and **norepinephrine** are two [[hormone|hormones]] that are used in the [[sympathetic nervous system]] of the [[autonomic nervous system]]\n\n\n\n\n___\n", "tags": [], "links": ["sympathetic nervous system", "autonomic nervous system", "hormone"]}, {"title": "eyes", "text": "---\naliases: [eyelid, eyelash, tarsal glands, conjunctiva, lacrimal apparatus, retina, cornea, iris, lens, sclera, posterior segment, anterior segment, vitreous humor, aqueous humor]\ntags: [biology, a&p]\n---\n# \ud83d\udc41 Eyes \ud83d\udc41\n---\nThe **eyes** are a pair of [[organ|organs]] that allow us the sense of **vision**.  They are filled with fluid, but otherwise hollow, and allow light in through a small aperture called the **pupil**. The light that entered the pupil hits the back of the eye, called the **retina**, which contains photoreceptors, which react with the light and transmit signals to the brain via the [[cranial nerves|optic nerve]]. These signals are then interpreted by the brain as [[vision]].\n\nThe eyes are are located in the [[head]], in **sockets** just for them, and are protected by accessory structures like **eyelids** and **eyebrows**. The **eyeball** itself is a fluid-filled spheroid that sits in the socket and can rotate around.\n\n## The Eyeball\nThe **eyeball** is a generally round structure which is made up of [[#The Tunics|several layers]] of tissue in a sphere that contains [[#Anterior & Posterior Segments|fluid]] on the inside.\n\n![[eye.png]]\n\n### The Tunics\nThere are three layers of layers called **tunics** that make up the \"shell\" of the eyeball, the **fibrous tunic**, the **vascular tunic** and the **neural tunic**.\n\n![[tunics of the eye.png]]\n\n- The **fibrous tunic** is sometimes called the **sclera** and it's the outermost layer. The anterior part of this tunic is transparent and makes up the **cornea**. \n- The **vascular tunic**, also called the **choroid layer**, houses the [[blood vessels|blood]] and [[lymphatic system|lymph]] vessels, as well as the [[capillaries]] and [[melanocytes]]. This layer also makes up the **ciliary body** which is attached to **ciliary ligaments** which can move the **lens** around to focus. This also is where the **dilator pupillae** muscles which control the diameter of the pupil.\n- The **neural tunic** is basically made up of the **retina**, which is is the \"back wall\" of the eye, where the light coming in through the pupil hits. It is made up of a delicate membrane full of **photoreceptors** and **pigments** that work together to react to react to light, and turn that into a signal our brains interpret as [[vision]].\n\n### Anterior & Posterior Segments\nThe inside of the eyeball is divided up into two segments, the **anterior** and the **posterior** segments.\n\nThe **posterior segment** is the larger of the two, and it makes up everything posterior to the lens. It is filled with ***vitreous* humor**, which stays fixed there, never draining away and being replenished. The pressure from the vitreous humor makes sure it keeps they eye the round shape.\n\nThe **anterior segment** is the smaller segment in front of the lens and it is filled with ***aqueous* humor**. You are constantly producing it, and it drains out of the **scleral venous sinus**. If it backs up you can even go blind. This is what they eye Dr. checks for when they check for pressure. A problem with this is that it's not painful if that happens, so especially after 40 you should get it checked regularly. \n\n## Accessory Structures\n### The Eyelids\nThe **eyelids** are an accessory structure that protects the eyeballs. The **eyelashes** extend out from the eyelids, and act to prevent particulate matter from falling into the eye.\n\nThere is a transparent membrane called **conjunctiva** that is made out of stratified columnar [[epithelial tissue|epithelium]] and covers the inside surface of the eyelid and the outside surface of the eyeball. The segment on the eyeball is called the **ocular conjunctiva** and the segment on the eyelid is called the **palpebral conjunctiva**.\n\nThere are upper and lower [[sebaceous glands]] called **tarsal glands** that are associated with the eyelids and eyelashes. These are what contribute to the \"sand\" in your eye when you wake up.\n\n![[eyelids.png]]\n\n### The Lacrimal Apparatus\nThe **lacrimal apparatus** produces, collects and drains fluid. When you blink it washes fluid over the eye. It drains into the **nasolacrimal duct**. \n\n## Problems with the Eyes\n**Pinkeye** is an infection of the [[#The Eyelids|conjunctiva]].\n\n**Retinal hemorrhages** is bleeding from the [[blood vessels]] in the retina.

There are several different approaches on *how* to achieve this end, depending on various factors such as the type of pathogen, and the technology available. \n\n## Inactivated or Killed Vaccines\n**Inactivated** or **killed vaccines** render the pathogen harmless by either killing it outright or inactivating them to the point of harmlessness. One way of achieving this is through the use of formeldahide. Although this provides the advantage that there is no way to actually be sick from them, they provide a relatively short-lived protection. As the antigens aren't producing an active infection, there is not enough of a chance to perform [[affinity maturation]] in order to produce high-affinity [[memory cells|memory cells]]. Booster shots contain the same antigen, which allow this step.\n\nSome examples of a killed or inactivated vaccine are: the conventional [[influenza|flu]] vaccine (that you get with a shot), and Polio (Salk) vaccine.\n\n## Attenuated Vaccine\n**Attenuated vaccines** use highly weakened versions of the pathogen so that our bodies can recognize them but they are usually past the point of being actually dangerous. The way that they do this is to just let the culture go and go for a very long time, so that the accumulated mutations render it weak enough to do no real damange. The advantages of using attenuated vaccines are that it can provide a long lasting protection, as the infection stays around long enough for us to be able to make high-affinity memory cells. The disadvantage is that there is the potential for the pathogen to back-mutate back into a form that is dangerous.\n\nSome examples of an attenuated vaccine are: measles/mumps/rubella, hepatits A, Polio (Sabin), and the nasal form of the flu vaccine.\n\n## Subunit Vaccine\n**Subunit vaccines** use just bits and pieces of the vaccine that can be recognized by our bodies as an antigen. The advantages of this type of vaccine are that there is not chance of us getting actually sick. The disadvantage of this type of vaccine is that the protections are short lived and booster shots may be required, as the subunits are not recognized by [[toll-like receptor|toll-like receptors]]. Because of this macrophages, dendritic cells do not recognize them, and thus [[helper T-cells]] do not get activated.\n\nSome examples of subunit vaccines are: hepatits B and the meningitis vaccine.\n\n## Toxoid Vaccine\n**Toxoid vaccines** are used when the agent that actually causes illness is a toxin that a bacteria (or virus?) produces. To make this vaccine we can take the toxin and denature it (usually by heating it up) so that it's shape changes enough that it won't be harmful, but not enough that it isn't recognizable by our system. This is called a \"toxoid\". The advantage of this type of vaccine is that there is no real way to get sick from it. The disadvantage is that it's protection is short-lived and booster shots may be required. \n\nSome examples of toxoid vaccines are: tetanus and diptheria\n\n## DNA Vaccines\n**[[DNA]] vaccines** are the newist form of vaccines (that only work on viruses) that trick our cells into making a select few recognizable pieces of a virus. This way, our own cells produces these proteins and it triggers a broad spectrum of immune response. One way to put that DNA into our cells is by using [[plasmid]] DNA into a little lipid molecule. \n\nThe good target cells for getting these plasmids into are our [[dendritic cells]] (that live just under the skin), as they can load up both their [[MHC molecule|MHC I and II]] molecules with it, which trigger both [[cytotoxic T-cells]]. Another good target for getting the DNA into is the [[muscle tissue]], as muscle cells tend to expel proteins that they make, which puts them into the environment so that [[B-cells]] can come across them.\n\n![[DNA vaccine.png]]\n\nThe advantages of DNA vaccines is that they are very cheap to mass produce, as once we have the plasmid we want, we can just keep growing colonies of bacteria with them inside it. Another advantage is that it allows us to expose our systems to the antigen in it's natural formation, instead of altering it in some way that makes it harmless. It also has the potential of activating cytotoxic T-cells, helper T-cells, *and* B-cells. The only real disadvantage is that there are none currently approved for use (at least in the US) as of May 2021.\n\n### Moderna/Pfizer/J&J [[COVID-19]] Vaccine\nThese vaccines pack the RNA (or DNA in J&J's case) into a [[lipid]] molceule, which can enter our cells via [[animal virus|membrane fusion]]. It does need to be kept very cold, as RNA is very unstable on it's own, especially when it is single stranded. The extra [[hydroxyl]] on the RNA is also very reactive and likes to cling to anything it can. The reason why Moderna and Pfizer need two doses is that it just gives an extra boost\u2014it's basically the same shot twice. J&J only needs one shot, but it's a bit less effective probably due to it needing to use an adenovirus to help it.\n\n## Conjugate Vaccines\n**Conjugate vaccines** are used for bacteria who have [[capsule|capsules]], because these capsules are made of carbohydrates, which are generally [[B-cells#T-Dependent Antigen|T-independent antigens]]. Because these don't produce [[memory cells]], that's not exactly ideal for a vacicne. The reason capsules can't flag down [[helper T-cells|helper T-cells]] is that carbohydrates cannot be loaded onto [[MHC molecule]] molecules. But if we attach a protein to the [[B-cells#T-Dependent Antigen|T-independent antigens]], then when that antigen is taken in, it *can* load up the protein portion, and get that [[helper T-cells]] activity.\n___", "tags": ["T"], "links": ["capsule", "helper T-cells", "muscle tissue", "hydroxyl", "toll-like receptor", "influenza", "COVID-19", "memory cells", "cytotoxic T-cells", "immune system", "lipid", "MHC molecule", "DNA", "pathogen", "animal virus", "plasmid", "dendritic cells", "B-cells", "affinity maturation"]}, {"title": "embryonic sexual differentiation", "text": "---\naliases: [mesonephric duct, paramesonephric duct, anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone, AMH, SRY gene, TDF region, intersex]\ntags: [reproductive, pregnancy]\n---\n# Embryonic Sexual Differentiation\n---\n**Sexual differentiation** happens early in the development of [[reproductive system]] in an [[pregnancy]]. \n\nDuring the first stage of development an embryo is \"sexually indifferent\", meaning there is **no physical difference between embryos of either genotypic sex**. During this time, all embryos have identical reproductive tracts and identical external genitalia. The undifferentiated reproductive tract consists of a **gonadal ridge** (home to germ cells that will become oocytes or sperm), a **paramesonephric duct** (AKA a m\u00fcllerian duct) and a **mesonephric duct**. (Spoiler: only one of these ducts will make it.)\n\n![[sexual differentiation.png]]\n\n**The sexually indifferent stage lasts until the sixth week of development**.

At about the seventh week, the the androgens from the SRY gene influences the [[testes]] to from from the undifferentiated gonads. Once the [[testes|sustentacular cells]] develop they release a hormone called **anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone**[^1] or **AMH**. AMH causes the paramesonephric (m\u00fcllerian) ducts to dissolve.

(The mesonephric ducts used to be called Wolffian ducts.)\n\nIf no androgens are released, then the paramesonephric ducts remain and the mesonephric ducts degenerate on their own.

This results in the releasing of [[energy]] and [[matter]] from the nucleus itself, and often end up transforming into a new element entirely. The process of changing into a new element is called **transmutation**. The radioactive decay and transmutation process will continue until a new, stable and non-radioactive element is formed.

Both D$_2$ and D$_3$ can also be converted to calcitriol.\n\n## Function\nVitamin D has myriad functions:\n- It works with [[calcium#Calcium Regulation|PTH]] to maintain blood calcium levels.\n- It assist the formation of [[bone|hydroxyapatites]] in the bone.\n- It decreases the formation of some [[cancer|cancerous]] tumors.\n- It assists in cell differentiation in various tissues.\n\n## Deficiencies\nA deficiency in vitamin D is strongly associated with a loss of bone mass, but can also cause aches, pains and tiredness in the short term, and [[hypertension]], [[cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], and [[cancer]] (especially breast cancer)\n\n### Loss of Bone Mass\nVitamin D can lead to a loss of bone mass because it is essential to the uptake of dietary [[calcium#Calcium Regulation|calcium]], among other things.\n\n- In children vitamin D deficiency a [[disease]] called **rickets**, which is a failure to get enough mineralization of the skeleton.\n- In adults vitamin D deficiency results in a \"soft bones\" disease called **osteomalacia** or in [[osteoporosis]].\n___\n", "tags": ["Calcium", "Provitamins"], "links": ["cancer", "hormone", "kidneys", "liver", "skin", "vitamin", "hypertension", "bone", "electromagnetic spectrum", "osteoporosis", "disease", "cardiovascular disease"]}, {"title": "bone", "text": "---\naliases: [hydroxyapatite, cortical bone, dense bone, compact bone, spongy bone, trabecular bone, diplo\u00eb, trabecula, periosteum, endosteum, short bone, flat bone, sesamoid bone, irregular bone]\ntags: [a&p, musculoskeletal]\n---\n# Bone \ud83e\uddb4\n---\nOur **bones** are the most obvious part of the [[musculoskeletal system]], and are made out of rigid yet flexible [[connective tissue|supportive connective tissue]]. Their function is to provide support for your body and protection for the internal organs. Bones are the body's main storage of [[calcium]], which can be released into the bloodstream by [[bone cells|osteoclasts]]. Human adults have roughly 206 individual bones and 306 [[joint|joints]]. \n\nAs a connective tissue, bone has a large amount of [[extracellular matrix|ECM]] which is very rigid, yet flexible enough to withstand a lot of stress. Bone ECM has a lot of [[collagen]] fibers in it, which makes it so flexible. They can take a lot of force, and if they do break they can [[bone repair|repair themselves]] quite readily.\n\nThe process of making bones is called [[ossification]]. Once the bone has been ossified, the bone itself can continue to grow either longways ([[interstitial growth]]) or in girth ([[appositional growth]]). [[Vitamin D]] is essential for bone growth because it helps [[calcium]] absorption, which is necessary for the the minerals associated with calcification. [[Vitamin C]] is essential for bone growth because it is required for [[collagen]] production. Bones are also constantly undergoing.\n\nThere are several types of [[bone cells]], such as osteoclasts, which break down bone material, osteoblasts that build up that material, and osteocytes which maintain it from within their own pockets of bone called **lacunae**. \n\n## Compact & Spongy Bone\nBones generally come in two forms, **compact bone** and **spongy bone**. Every bone in the skeleton has at least some component of compact bone, while certain ones have an additional segment of spongy bone in the center.\n\n![[compact and spongy bone.png]]\n\n### Compact Bone \n**Compact bone** also called **cortical** or **dense bone**, is a the hard, dense type of bone tissue that you really think of when you think of \"bones\". It comprises about 80% of our skeletons, and has a slower rate of turnover than spongy bone, meaning it is much less sensitive to hormonal or dietary changes.\n\n### Spongy Bone\n**Spongy bone** , also called **trabecular bone** or **diplo\u00eb** is a much less dense version of bone tissue that has a pocked, sponge-like appearance to the naked eye (hence the name). The main, noodle-like formations of the spongy bone are called **trabeculae**, which are somewhat like miniature, solid [[bone|osteons]] in compact bone. [[bone cells|Osteocytes]] live in their lacuna along the lamellae, and can reach their nutrients by the canaliculi that open to the outside. Because of this, spongy bone is lighter, more resistant to stress, and can act like a scaffolding to the compact bone. It's found in the [[long bone#Epiphysis & Diaphysis|epiphyses and diaphyses]] of long bones, in vertebral bones, the sternum, ribs, skull and pelvis.\n\n>[!tip]- The medullary cavity is not filled with spongy bone \n> When first learning about the features of bones, I somehow came to the understanding that the [[long bone#Medullary Cavity|medullary cavity]] of long bones were filled with spongey bone, and the bone marrow \"filled in the gaps\" around the trabeculae. This just isn't true.\n\n## Periosteum & Endosteum\nThe **periosteum** is a fibrous membrane that covers the whole outside of the bone (except at the joints, which is covered with a thin layer of [[cartilage|articular cartilage]]. The **endosteum** is similar to the periosteum, but it covers the inside of the [[long bone#Medullary Cavity|medullary cavity]] and the [[#spongy bone|trabeculae]] of spongy bone. They contain [[blood vessels|blood]] and [[lymphatic system|lymph vessels]] and [[nerves]].\n\nThese are where are where [[bone remodeling]] and [[appositional growth]] take place, and where [[tendons]] and [[ligaments]] attach to the bone.\n\n## Hydroxyapatites\nThe combination of rigidity and flexibility is the vital quality of the bone [[extracellular matrix|ECM]]\u2014It must be rigid enough to provide support, yet flexible enough to withstand a lot of stress. The rigidity comes from tiny mineral crystals called **hydroxyapatites**. These cluster around [[collagen]] fibers, which grants the bone it's flexibility. Bones are about 65% mineral (mostly [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]]) and 35% organic substances.\n\n![[bone molecular structure.png]]\n\n## Classifications\nBones come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but there are some features that can be used to describe all bones. There are five different shapes that bones can be categorized by: **long bones**, **short bones**, **flat bones**, **sesamoid bones** and **irregular bones**.\n\n![[bone type.png]]\n\n- [[long bone|Long bones]] are the most \"bone\" looking bones. They are cylindrical and longer than they are wide, which function as levers and work with muscles to move around.\n- **Short bones** are pretty cube shaped, with roughly equal dimensions. These are only found in the wrists and ankles, and function to provide stability and support.\n- **Flat bones** are flat in that they are pretty thin, but they are not straight flat, they are usually curved. These bones usually function as attachment for muscles and protection for internal organs. They have three layers, two layers of compact bone on either side of a layer of spongy bone.\n- **Sesamoid bones** are bones that are sesame seed shaped. They protect tendons from compressive forces by acting like pulleys. Not everyone has the same number of and placement of sesamoid bones, but they are usually found in the hands, feet, knees and neck.\n- **Irregular bones** are all the other types of bones that can't be classified otherwise. They are generally complex shapes like vertebrae or the small bones in the ears.\n\n# Bones?\n___\n\n\n\n\n", "tags": ["spongy", "Epiphysis", "Medullary"], "links": ["connective tissue", "ossification", "phosphorus", "blood vessels", "lymphatic system", "ligaments", "nerves", "appositional growth", "bone repair", "bone cells", "musculoskeletal system", "collagen", "tendons", "calcium", "long bone", "extracellular matrix", "interstitial growth", "cartilage", "bone", "joint", "bone remodeling"]}, {"title": "pregnancy", "text": "---\naliases: [gestation, morning sickness]\ntags: [reproductive]\n---\n# Pregnancy\n---\n**Pregnancy**, which can also be called the is the period of time that a [[female]] grows a new human in their [[uterus]].

The first 5 years after [[menopause]] it occurs much faster, at a rate of 5% a year. \n- **Gender**: Females are at a higher risk for osteoporosis for 3 main reasons:\n\t- Females have lower absolute bone mass to begin with\n\t- Hormonal changes for females are more severe than for males\n\t- Females have a higher life expectancy, and therefore have more opportunity to develop osteoporosis. \n- **Genetics**\n- **Tobacco, Alcohol, Caffeine Use**\n\t- Caffeine can increase the amount of [[calcium]] excreted in the urine.\n- **Nutrition**: Too much or not enough of certain nutrients, such as:\n\t- Calcium and Vitamin D are vital, especially during adolescence.\n\t- Sodium can increase the output of [[calcium]] in the urine. \n- **Exercise**: Regular exercise is highly protective of osteoporosis by putting healthy stress on the bones, triggering more [[ossification|bone growth]].\n\n![[osteoporosis x-ray.png]]\n\n## Prevention/Treatment\nOsteoporosis is ultimately due to bones loosing their mineral salts (hydroxyapatites?) and [[collagen]] fibers, which is what happens when the rate of resorption during [[bone remodeling]] is greater than the rate of bone building.

As the spermatocytes develop they move away from the edge of the seminiferous tubule and squeeze between two sustentacular cells on either side, on their way to the lumen of the tube.

The result is cations are attracted to them, all other factors (such as concentration gradient) being equal.  \n2. **There are two pulls on all the ions: a concentration gradient and an electrostatic gradient**. For example, K$^+$ seeks to leave the cell to lower it's steep concentration gradient, but is also pulled by it's electrostatic gradient caused primarily by the anions present in the cell. The point at which the pull of the concentration gradient equals the pull of the electrostatic gradient is called that ion's *equilibrium potential*.

They work by binding to and disabling an enzyme called [[peptidoglycan#Transpeptidase|transpeptidase]] that binds together the sugar chains forming the cell wall. A cell wall thus weakened can then fall apart and kill the bacteria.\n\n![[transpeptidase.png]]\n\nIt's important to note that this will not harm a cell wall that has already been formed, but it *will* prevent the synthesis of a new one.\n\n### Prevention of Protein Synthesis\nBy preventing the [[translation]] of new proteins, the bacteria cannot survive.\n\n#### Tetracycline and Erythromycin\n**Tetracycline and Erythromycin** work by binding to prokaryotic [[ribosome|ribosomes]] and deactivating them.\n\nThese are selectivly toxic because prokaryotic ribosomes have a different structure than eurkaryotic ribosomes. Even so, there is a danger of causing harm to our own cells eventually because our [[mitochondria]] are basically their own bacteria living in our cells, and therefore *do* have prokaryotic ribosomes.  \n\n### Prevention of Nucleic Acid Synthesis\nBy preventing [[nucleic acid]] synthesis, the bacteria cannot survive. \n\n#### Quinolones\n**Quinolones** are a class of antibiotic that work by binding to and deactivating enzymes that are vital to [[DNA replication]], such as topoisomerase.\n\n![[DNA replication.png]]\n\nThese are selectivly toxic because prokaryotic enzymes are slightly different than eukaryotic ones.\n\n### Growth Factor Analogs\n**Growth factors** are something that a cell needs in order to grow or heal, like a nutrient. Growth factor *analogs* are molecules that are similar enough in shape for the cell to try to take it in an use it, but they don't actually provide any value to the organism.\n\n#### Sulfonamides\n**Sulfonamides** are a class of antibiotic that arePABA (para-aminobenzioc acid)  analogs. Bacteria need PABA in order to produce folic acid, which is an ingredient in [[nucleotide|nucleotides]]. The sulfonamide binds to the enzyme that converts PABA into [[vitamin B|folic acid]] and just stays there, blocking up the active site and rendering the enzyme useless. \n\nThese are selectivly toxic because we humans can't actually make folic acid on our own, and we just take it in our diet as [[vitamin B|vitamin B]]. \n___\n\n\n\n", "tags": ["Transpeptidase"], "links": ["antibiotic resistance", "bacteria", "normal microbiota", "nucleic acid", "ribosome", "Gram positive bacteria", "DNA replication", "translation", "antimicrobial drugs", "nucleotide", "cell wall", "vitamin B", "Gram negative bacteria", "mitochondria"]}, {"title": "virulence", "text": "---\naliases: [virulence factor, adhesin, siderophore, pathogenicity, syncytium]\ntags: [biology, microbiology]\n---\n# Virulence\n---\n**Virulence** is a measument of how [[pathogen|pathogenic]]\u2014or likely to cause [[disease]]\u2014a [[microbe]] is.\n\n## Virulence Factors\nA **virulence factor** (which as far as I can tell is the same thing as a \"mechanism of pathogenicity\") is a trait or characteristic that allows a [[microbe]] to *cause* disease. We will look at 4 different virulence factors.\n\n### The Ability to Adhere to, Colonoze in or Invade the Host Tissue\nSome pathogens have **adhesins** which give them the ability to adhere or latch onto molecules that are normally found on the surface of their host cells.\n\nSome pathogens have the ability to leech away iron from the host in order to make a colony, as iron is essential for building up the [[ETC (bacterial)|ETC]]. One way they can do this is by producing thier own iron-binding molecules called **siderophores**.\n\nSome pathogens can \"force\" a host cell to endocytosize them in, such as *[[salmonella#Salmonella Gaining Entry to Cells|Salmonella]]*.\n\nSome pathogens, again like *[[peyer's patches#M Cells and Salmonella|Salmonella]]* can hitch a ride though methods like in M cells. There they can replicate and disseminate into the host. \n\n### The Ability to Evade Host's Innate Defense\nSome pathogens can work around our [[innate immune system]], like [[tuberculosis#Surviving Phagocytosis|tuberculosis]] who can prevent themselves from being phagocytized. TB does this by preventing the formation of the [[phagocytosis#Step 4 The Phagolysosome|phagosolysosome]] once inside the phagocyte.\n\nAnother example is how *[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae#Gonorrhoeae Produces It's Own Sialic Acid|gonorrhoeae]]* can produce it's own [[complement protein|sialic acid]], and thus be protected from our [[complement protein|complement proteins]]. \n\n### The Ability to Evade Host's Adaptive Defense\nSome pathogens can fight our [[adaptive immune system]] directly, like how *[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae#Gonorrhoeae can Degrade IgA Antibodies|gonorrhoeae]]* can produce IgA protease, which degrades IgA antibodies.\n\nSome pathogens can render any [[antibody|antibodies]] that bind to them useless by altering *how* they bind to them. Our own cells can \"see\" the opsonized antibodies because they have an [[antibody structure|Fc receptor]] which binds to that region of the antibody. However, these pathogens also have an Fc receptor, which makes it so the \"wrong\" end is facing outward, and none of our cells can use them.\n\nSome pathogens, like [[HIV]] can induce the formtion of a \"syncytium,\" or a single cell with multiple nuclei. By fusing together multiple host cells, the virus can move around undetected by antibodies, that only bind to free-floating pathogens.\n\n![[syncytium.png]]\n\n### The Ability to Damage our Cells\n#### Toxins\nSome pathogens can damage our cells through the use of [[toxin|toxins]].\n\n#### Damage to Connective Tissues\nSome pathogens can cause damage to our [[connective tissue]]. They can realease \"proteases\" that breaks down proteins, \"lipases\" that break down lipids, like those found in [[plasma membrane|cell membranes]], and \"collagenases\" that break down [[collagen]] in our ECM. \n\n#### Unintentional Damange by Immune Response.\nSome pathogens cause unintentional damage to the host cell due to the host's [[immune system|immune response]]. This can be because of prolonged [[inflammation]], which is something that *[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae#Gonorrhoeae Causes Indirrect Damage to Uturus and Overies|gonorrhoeae]]* can actually do if they infect the cervix. \n___", "tags": ["Surviving", "Gonorrhoeae", "M", "Salmonella", "Step"], "links": ["toxin", "connective tissue", "plasma membrane", "antibody structure", "immune system", "HIV", "complement protein", "collagen", "pathogen", "inflammation", "innate immune system", "microbe", "ETC (bacterial)", "disease", "adaptive immune system", "antibody"]}, {"title": "protozoa", "text": "---\naliases: [protist]\ntags: [biology, microbiology]\n---\n# Protozoa\n---\n**Protozoa** are an (informal?) kingdom in the domain [[eukaryote|eukarya]] that are not animals, plants, or fungi.

Physicians thus need to find out The practitioners of western health care tend to believe what the patient believes caused the problem, and treat\u00a0 that their approaches to healing are superior to all others. that as well.\n\n- **Cope**: How will you cope with your condition?\nThis will provide the health care provider with important behavior, for our behavior generally reflects our values. information on the possible use of alternative healers and treatments. Most people will try home remedies before coming to a physician; however, few will share such information due to fear of ridicule or chastisement. However, it is essential that the question be family, or occupation. Other cultures, such as Asian, are asked in a nonjudgmental way, or patients will likely not hierarchical: everyone is not equal. Status comes from share such information. Ask in a tone that implies that of age, sex, and occupation. And these differences are course, everyone tries home remedies before coming.\n\n- **Concerns**: What are your concerns regarding the condition and/or the recommended treatment?\nFind out the main concerns regarding their condition and treatment. Address questions such as, \u201cHow serious do you think this is?\u201d \u201cWhat potential complications do you fear?\u201d \u201cHow does it interfere with your life, or your ability to function?\u201d \u201cDo you know anyone else who has tried the treatment I\u2019ve recommended?

For blood returning from they [[circulation|systemic circuit]] this blood is deoxygenated, and for blood returning from the [[circulation|pulmonary circuit]] it is oxygenated. \n\n## Features of Veins\nIn order for exchange at the capillaries to work, most of the blood pressure from the heart has dissipated. This has many ramifications which affect the anatomy of the veins. For one, since they do not have to withstand such a strong pressure, they relax when empty. In cross sections of tissue, veins can be identified because they squish down.\n\n>[!health] Blood Reservoir\nWithout the same drive to move blood, veins actually act as a \"stockroom\" of blood, since they have lower [[blood pressure]] there is more blood at any time in the veins than the arteries. In a way when your heartrate increases during exercise you get access to more blood.\n\nVeins have internal **valves** that allow blood to pass one way (towards the heart) and do not allow them to return back the other way. Thus blood can only move one way through the veins. Some of this happens through gravity, or pressure from the blood coming in from the arteries, but there are two really important \"pumps\" that squeeze blood through the veins.\n\n### Skeletal Muscle & Respiratory Pumps\nThe **skeletal muscle pump** works when the skeletal muscles of the body squish the veins like a tube of tooth paste. Since the valves prevent the blood from going backwards, it squishes all the blood forward. This is why walking is so good for circulation\u2014the gastrocnemius (calf muscle) is sometimes called the \"second heart\" because of it's important role in pumping blood.\n\nThe **respiratory pump** works in much the same fashion as the skeletal muscle pump, only instead of using the physical pressure of the muscles squishing the veins, it uses the pressure that builds up in the thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities during [[breathing|pulmonary ventilation]] to squish the veins.\n\n## Venous Return\n**Venous return** is the amount of blood that returns to the heart through the veins. The heart can only pump the blood that comes back to it, so increasing venous return gives the heart more blood to pump, and therefore increases [[cardiac output]].\n\nAccording to the [[stroke volume|Frank-Starling law]] of the heart, the more venous return that comes into the heart, the stronger the contractility of the heart, the more blood that gets pushed out of the heart on each beat.\n\n### Factors Affecting Venous Return\n\n- [[exercise]] increases venous return (see the pumps above)\n\n## Problems with the Veins\n\n- [[venous insufficiency]]\n- [[deep vein thrombosis]]\n- [[varicose veins]] when the valves don't work well and blood pools\n\n___\n\n\n\n", "tags": [], "links": ["venous insufficiency", "capillaries", "blood pressure", "breathing", "stroke volume", "blood vessels", "circulation", "heart", "cardiac output", "deep vein thrombosis", "exercise"]}, {"title": "oculomotor nerve", "text": "---\naliases: [CN III]\ntags: [nervous]\n---\n# The Oculomotor Nerve (CN III)\n---\nThe **oculomotor nerve** (CN III) is the [[cranial nerves|cranial nerve]] that is responsible for movement of the [[eyes]]\u2014it's a **motor nerve**.

The information is stored in your [[brain]] such that you can recall that information easily and effectively. Essentailly, something you have learned is stored in a pattern of [[neurons]] that are accustomed to all firing at the same time. Learning something is basically just firing those related neurons together over and over until they aclimatize themselves to be firing together.\n\nLearning can be strange. We consider certian abilities, like understand complex [[mathematics|math]] or doing well at chess to be difficut to achieve. We prize these hard-won abilites, and yet computers can easily beat us in these fields. Other skills, such as seeing, hearing, reaching, running come naturally to us humans, but are very difficult for compters to master. In order to learn, first information must be [[encoding|encoded]] into our [[memory]], and then we must be able to [[retrieval|recall]] that information when needed.\n\nIt's easy to get into the mental frame that forgetting information is a terrible foible of the human brain, and must be fought against constantly. It might seem this way when trying to learn a lot of information, but the brain **forgetting information is a feature, not a bug**. Your brain is already increadably resource-hungry, and if it tried to remember every bit of information that it came across, it would literally explode. It already does some of this with [[sensory gating]] and [[neural adaptation]], to prevent stimuli overload.\n\nOur [[memory|working memory]] really only has about 4 spots that you can hold at any given time. When learning you need to be able to thing of more than just 4 things at once. Fortunatly, the neural phenominon of [[chunking]] information together can group smaller pieces of related information together so that it only takes up one \"spot\" in your working memory.  \n\n## Using Focused & Diffuse Modes\nOur brains can be (generally speaking) [[Focused and diffuse modes]] are the two modes of thinking or problem solving that our brains can be in. Both are useful for helping us learn, but they are quite different from one another in how thoughts move about your neural pathways.\n\n## Learning Techniques\n**Einstellung** (German, meaning \"mindset\") is when your initial, simple thought that you already have a strong neural pattern for prevents a better idea or solution from being found. It's like getting stuck in a mental rut. Good learning breaks out of this einstellung, and let's us form new nerual connections. \n\n### Sleep\nGood quality and quantity of [[sleep]] **is essential for learning**. It is particulary important for two reasons: \n\n- Sleep allows the toxic metabolic byprducts be washed away from the brain. During sleep the brain cells actually shrink down in size and allow for the passage of [[cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] to wash over them.\n- Sleep is an opportunity to go into super [[focused and diffuse modes|diffuse mode]] where your brain can really bounce new ideas around, and go over new pathways over and over, as well as allowing ones that are not important to fade away. The old school of thought was that [[synapse|synapses]] can be strenghthened by learning, but do not reconfigure\u2014but this is wrong! Our synapses reconfigure all the time, especially after sleep!\n\n### Interleaving\nSwitching between practicing different types of problems can be benificial. This is where you build up *flexiblity* and *creativity* by jumping around to differnet sections.\n\n**Active Recall**\nActive [[retrieval|recall]] is the act of actually working to come up with the answers from a freash state\u2014instead of simply looking up the answer and reviewing\u2014and it is a very effective learning method. The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning. \n\n### Creating Habits\n**Habits** are when you do something automatically, like you have chunked an action and you don't have to spend a lot of energy on doing it. They generally occur in four parts: \n\n1. **The cue** that triggers the habit. Changing this part is the eaisest to do.\n2. **The routine** that is the actual \"habit\" part.\n3. **The reward** that enforces the behavior with an immidiate gratification.\n4. **The belief**.

This is a *fundamental process* found in all living things, and it's part of the [[central dogma of biology]]. The process of copying a genome is remarkably similar between *all* organism, no exception. All organisms have DNA, and all organisms have to copy it, and this started a *long* time ago. \n\nDNA replication is also mind-bogglingly accurate, but humans have over 6 billion base pairs, and some are bound to be [[DNA mistakes|put in wrong]]. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though, and without it [[evolution]] would not work the way we understand it.\n\nBecause this is a *very complex process* and *very important* process, it is *highly* regulated. The **replisome** is a large protein complex that has many many specialized enzyme that carry out the varied processes involved in replication.\n\n![[DNA replication.png]]\n\n## Step 1: Unzipping\nIn order for the replication to happen, first the strand of DNA must be opened up, or \"unzipped\" for anything to be able to read the nucleotides of the DNA. A special enzyme called **DNA helicase** begins this \"unzipping\" at a specific, predetermined spot, which is what we call the *origin of replication*.\n\nFrom that single point, two separate helicases moves out in either direction, forming what is called a [[replication bubble]]. DNA helicase uses ATP to power the [[hydrolysis and condensation reactions|hydrolysis]] that separates the strands between their two [[nucleotide#Nitrogenous Bases|nitrogenous bases]]\n\n In order for them to not just immediately bind back together (or to themselves) before they get a chance to be replicated, a bunch of tiny proteins called **single-stranded DNA-binding proteins**, or **SSBPs** bind them right away and \"hold\" them open.\n\nThere is another important consideration during DNA replication, which is that DNA is helical, and separating the strands twists the molecule, like how thread knots if you try to separate *its* strands. **DNA topoisomerase** is a special enzyme that relieves this tension by cutting the DNA ahead of the replication fork and then rebinding them.\n \n## Step 2: Laying The RNA Primer\nThe **RNA primer** is the essential starting piece for the actual polymerization process. [[DNA polymerase]] is *unable* to just start laying down DNA [[nucleotide|nucleotides]], because it relies on the [[ribose and deoxyribose#5' Carbon The Phosphate Group|5' carbon]] of the sugar molecule to power the reaction. In order to get it started a special kind of [[RNA polymerase]] called **DNA primase** lays down a short set of [[RNA]] nucleotides\u2014the RNA primer. Once down, DNA polymerase can come in behind, latch on to the primer, and begin work.\n\n## Step 3: Replication\nAn enzyme called **DNA polymerase III** or **Pol III** does the heavy lifting of replicating the strands. It can latch onto the RNA primer and begin laying down [[complementary base pairing|complementary bases]]. It is extrodinarily accurate, but [[DNA mistakes|mistakes]] do happen. Fortunately pol III has the ability to [[DNA proofreading|proofread]] as it goes.\n\nEach strand is complementary, but they are also [[DNA structure#Antiparallelity|antiparallel]] to each other. This important because DNA replication `can only happen in the 5' \u2192 3' direction`, but the replisome only moves one direction. This means that there are two different approaches for the two different strands.\n\n### Step 3a: The Leading Strand\nThe **leading strand** is being unzipped in the 3' \u2192 5' direction, which means the new complementary strand that [[DNA polymerase|DNA polymerase III]] lays down is facing the in the 5' \u2192 3' direction, which is the *easy direction*. So pol III can come along, latch to the primer, and just keep chugging all they way down till the end of the strand, loop, or until it merges with another [[replication bubble]]. It moves quite quickly, and [[DNA proofreading|proofreads]] as it goes.\n\nBehind pol III, [[DNA polymerase|DNA polymerase I]] comes behind, removes the primer, replaces it with DNA [[nucleotide|nucleotides]] and does a second sweep of [[DNA proofreading]].\n\n### Step 3b: The Lagging Strand\nThe **lagging strand** is being unzipped in the 5' -> 3' direction, which is *much* more complicated. When the [[replication bubble]] is formed there isn't a lot of room to work with, so DNA primase lays down a primer and [[DNA polymerase|DNA polymerase III]] does what it can\u2014but only manages a short strip. Fortunately, by that time there is a little more room \"behind\" the first strip, so the whole process can begin again. This time [[DNA polymerase|pol III]] bumps into the start of the first fragment's [[#Step 2 Laying The RNA Primer|primer]]. [[DNA polymerase|Pol III]] cannot attach the end of its DNA segment to the beginning of the RNA primer, so the fragments are left disjointed. But by that time there is more room behind them, and they repreat the process yet again. This continues all they way down, which leaves a whole series of short (usually ~150-200 bases long), unconnected segments of RNA and DNA called **Okazaki fragments**. \n\n![[okazaki fragments.png]]\n\nLike with the leading strand [[DNA polymerase|DNA polymerase I]] comes behind [[DNA polymerase|pol III]], removing the (much more frequent) unstable RNA primers, laying down the DNA [[nucleotide|nucleotides]], and performing a second round of [[DNA proofreading|proofreading]]. Another enzyme called **DNA ligase** joins all the disconected Okazaki fragments up toghere again.\n\n>[!people]\n>Okazaki fragments were discovered by the husband/wife team, **Tsuneko and Reiji Okazaki**.\n>\n## The END Problem\nThe **END problem** is the problem we run into at the end (get it?) of the lagging strand. As the RNA primer must sit on existing DNA, it's very likely that, even if it is very close to the very end of the strand, it won't be exactly *at* the end of the strand. Thus, we loose a little bit of our [[telomere|telomeres]] at the end of every DNA replication.\n\n\n%%line break below%%\n___\n\n\n\n", "tags": ["Step", "5", "Antiparallelity", "Nitrogenous"], "links": ["DNA polymerase", "complementary base pairing", "RNA", "central dogma of biology", "nucleotide", "DNA mistakes", "hydrolysis and condensation reactions", "evolution", "DNA", "replication bubble", "DNA proofreading", "RNA polymerase", "telomere"]}, {"title": "vitamin A", "text": "---\naliases: [retinol, retinal, retinoic acid]\ntags: [biology, nutrition]\n---\n# Vitamin A\n---\n**Vitamin A** is a [[vitamin]] that is particular associated with [[eyes]] health.\n\n## Formation\nVitamin A can be formed by cleaving [[\u03b2-carotene]].

It is generally the \"high reasoning\" area, and is the part of the brain for problem solving, judgment and reasoning, as well as speaking.\n\nThe **parietal lobe** is located most superiorly, under the crown of the skull, and it's main job is for processing [[afferent nervous system|sensory]] information.\n\nThe **temporal lobe** is located to the sides of the brain, and it is in charge of [[ears|hearing]] and [[nose|smell]].\n\nThe **occipital lobe** is located in the very back of the brain and it is in charge of [[vision]].\n\nThe **insula** is located deep in the cerebrum and is often hidden from view.\n\n## White Matter\nThe **white matter** makes up the bulk of the cerebrum. It has a white appearance (hence the name) because it is made up of [[myelination|myelinated]] fibers (or long cell axons). There are several different types of fibers:\n\n**Association fibers** connect different parts of the brain together.\n\n**Projection fibers** take [[afferent nervous system|sensory]] information received by the brain from the \"post office\" [[thalamus]], and sends that information to where it needs to go.\n\n**Commissural fibers** are what make up the [[corpus colosseum]], which connects the two halves of the brain.\n\n## Cerebral Cortex\nThe **cerebral cortex** is the most recognizable structure of the cerebrum. It is the outside lumpy layer of gray matter. The unique topography of the cerebral cortex can be described by the **gyri** (sing: **gyrus***)\u2014or the ridges\u2014and the **sulci** (sing: **sulcus**)\u2014or the valleys between the gyri. Particularly deep sulci are called **fissures**. The formation of the gyri and sulci are surprisingly regular from person to person, and many have specific names.\n\n![[cerebral gyri.png]]\n![[cerebral sulci.png]]\n\nLocated within specific locations of the gray matter are the individual **cortexes**, which are specialized areas of the brain where a single type of processing occurs.\n\n### Important Cortices\nThe **prefrontal cortex** is located in the frontal lobe, and is the responsible for judgment and reasoning. The prefrontal cortex is virtually absent from [[infant|infants]], and is not fully developed until around age 25. The impulsivity in [[life-span development|adolescents]] is related in part to an increase in the speed of thinking (due to increased [[myelination]]) and a still-underdeveloped prefrontal cortex. It is a highly important cortex in the field of [[psychology]]\n\nThe **premotor cortex** conducts learned movements or behaviors. It's our \"muscle memory\", which helps us do things like ride a bike or type on a keyboard.\n\nThe **primary motor cortex** and **primary somatosensory cortex** are located in the *pre* and *post*central gyrus respectively. These are where our body maps the motor and sensory information for specific areas of the body, in structures called **homunculi**. \n\n## Basal Nuclei\nThe **basal nuclei**, sometimes called the **cerebral nuclei** or simply **ganglion**[^1] are located in the middle parts of the brain. Collectively they have functions related to our motor skills, such as providing precise motor timing control and coordination. Without these structures our movements would be jerky, erratic and uncoordinated.\n\n[^1]: Although it is sometimes used, the term \"ganglion\" is best restricted to clusters of neuron cell bodies located *outside* of the CNS, whereas \"nucleus\" is the same structure *within* the CNS.\n\nThe **putamen** helps control movements on subconscious level.\n\nThe **globus pallidus** influences the [[thalamus]] to adjust [[muscle tone]].\n\nThe **caudate nucleus** helps produce a smooth walking [[gait]] by overseeing the pattern and rhythm of the movement. \n\nThe [[amygdala]] is small, but particularly important in the recognition and regulation of emotions, and a big part of the [[limbic system]].\n\n![[basal nuclei.png]]\n\n%%this line intentionally left blank%%", "tags": ["cerebral", "white", "basal"], "links": ["intelligence", "myelination", "life-span development", "amygdala", "brain", "gait", "vision", "infant", "afferent nervous system", "ears", "limbic system", "thalamus", "nose", "psychology"]}, {"title": "culture", "text": "---\naliases: [ecological systems theory, Bronfenbrenner]\ntags: [psych]\n---\n# Culture\n---\n**Culture** is a [[social construct]] that is a system of shared beliefs, connections, norms, behaviors, expectations, and symbolic representations that persist over time. This is important to understand in terms of [[life-span development]], and this is what is meant when they say \"development is multicultural\". Especially interesting is when two different cultures that an individual belongs to clash.\n\n[[cultural humility]]\n\nCulture is a crucial filter through which people \"learn how to be in the world, how to behave, what to value, and what gives meaning to existence\" (Schim and Doorenbos, 2010, p. 256). Cultural patterns are socially transmitted through family, and other social institutions. They are an essential part of personal identity. People pass down social customs (\"the way we do things\"), cultural beliefs, values, and language, from one generation to the next (Giger et al, 2007). Cultures evolve, but vestiges from the past can still influence behavior and communication in the resent.\n\nThe most obvious example of culture is that which somewhat mirrors nationality\u2014Japanese culture, British culture, Peruvian culture, etc\u2014but cultures exist in almost every aspect of our lives. There's a work culture specific to your work, a school culture, a family culture, and so on. **Everyone belongs to multiple cultures simultaneously**, simply by interacting with different groups throughout the day/week/year.\n\n## The Ecological Systems Theory\nThe **ecological systems theory** is a theory or frameworks for understanding human [[life-span development|development]], by taking into account the myriad of systems that all interact and influence a person's development.\n\n>[!people]- Urie Bronfenbrenner\n>The exological-systems approach was pioneered by developmentalist **Urie Bronfenbrenner**, and is sometimes refered to as \"Bronfenbrenner's exological framework\".\n\nThere are three **primary systems**, and two **special systems**. The primary systems are these: \n\n- The **microsystem** is the most immediate system, and it has the most direct, obvious effect. It consists of one's family, and peers, the religious or school institutions one attends, and the neighborhood one lives in.\n- The **exosystem** is the system that are still immediate, but not direct. This includes a parent's work environment, which affects the parent, which affects the child. Another example is the types and influences of local institutions, such as medical facilities, mass media or the educational system.\n- The **macrosystem** is the larger social setting and culture in the region the individual lives in. This includes [[socioeconomic status|SES]], industry, mass media, social services and policies.\n\nThe special systems are these:\n\n- The **mesosystem** is the result of the interactions between the other systems, such as the relationship between a child's parents and their teachers.\n- The **chronosystem** is the pattern of environmental events and transitions over the course of one's lifetime. For example, if parents divorce, which causes some chaos initially, then levels off after a few years.\n\n![[ecological systems.png]]\n\n___\n", "tags": [], "links": ["life-span development", "socioeconomic status", "cultural humility", "social construct"]}, {"title": "cell wall", "text": "---\naliases: [microfibril, pectin, lignin, turgor pressure, middle lamella]\ntags: [biology, cell]\n---\n# Cell Wall\n---\nThe **cell wall** is a feature of [[plants|plant]] cells that give it a sturdy shape and structure.  It's increadably rigid. This is is what allows trees to grow so tall, and be so tough.\n\n## Cell Wall in Plants\nThe cell wall in plants is made up of a primary cell wall and a secondary cell wall.\n\n![[plant cell wall.png]]\n\n### Primary Cell Wall\nThe **primary cell wall** helps shape the plant It is very tough it can resist the strong [[osmosis|osmotic]] pressure.\n\n#### Structure\nThe initial fiber composite of the primary cell wall is made up of [[cellulose]] strands, which are bunched up into cables called \"microfibrils\". The microfibrils are arranged in a criss-cross pattern via [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]]. These microfibrils are synthesized directly into the ECM.\n\nThe space surrounding the microfibrils is filled with gelatinous [[polysaccharide|polysaccharides]] like \"pectin\". These polysaccharides are highly hydrophilic, so they can hold a lot of water to keep the cells moist. These are synthesized in the [[endomembrane system|rough ER]] and the [[endomembrane system|Golgi apparatus]] before being secreted. \n\n![[primary cell wall.png]]\n\n#### Function\nThe primary cell wall is very important for it's ability to resist the strong \"turgor pressure\" that is present. The [[concentration gradient|concentration]] of solutes is generally much higher inside the cell, so water will constantly try to enter the cell via [[osmosis]]. This force increases the cell's volume and pushes the [[plasma membrane]] up against the cell wall.\n\n#### The Primary Cell Wall During Plant Growth\nDuring young **plant growth**, the plant excretes \"expansins\" that loosen the criss-cross of microfibrils, allowing the turgur pressure expand the cell walls. \n\n### Secondary Cell Wall\nThe **secondary cell wall** is an (optional) layer of material between the [[plasma membrane]] and primary cell wall of [[plants|plant]] cells. What it is made of varries by type of cell and that cell's function\u2014for example, some might have a waxy coating, or provide extra support by having aditional cellulose. Woody cells have a complex polymer called \"lignin\", which is exceptionally rigid. \n\n### Middle Lamella\nThe **middle lamella** is like the glue that holds the cells together.

Acetate can then be converted into [[acetyl CoA]].\n\nFor alcoholics, an alternate pathway, the **microsomal ethanol oxidizing system** or **MEOS** kicks in. This pathway is inducible, which means the enzymes for it can be produced in higher and higher numbers.\n\n![[alcohol metabolism.png]]\n\n### First-Pass Metabolism\n**First-pass metabolism** occurs in the stomach, where gastric ADH oxidizes the alcohol before it even has a chance to enter the bloodstream. This has a huge effect on alcohol tolerance; for example, women have less of this enzyme in general, so more alcohol \"gets out of the stomach\" and can enter the bloodstream. \n\n### More Alcohol, More MEOS\nIn the liver, the ADH pathway handles the oxidation of alcohol for non-alcoholoics. As the person drinks more and more over time, the ADH pathway looses efficience and MEOS takes over. This actually acts to increase the liver's alcohol metabolism efficience greatly, which is why a heavy drinker \"builds up a tolerance\". \n\nMEOS also metabolises a bunch of OTC, prescription and recreational drugs as well, which can be a problem if you mix drugs and alcohol.

The number of receptors present, or the ability of a receptor to actually bind to the [[signaling molecule]] can weaken or strengthen, depending on the strength and frequency of signals that they receive. For example, the number of receptors on a particular cell may decline of hormonal stimulation occurs at high levels over a long time.\n\n**Receptors can be blocked**. Other molecules that are not the signaling molecule, but look (i.e. are shaped) *very* similarly to the ligand can bind to the receptor, interfering with it's ability to bind to the true [[signaling molecule]]. This is how a lot of drugs work\u2014by \"blocking\" the signal. \n\n## Intracellular Receptors\n**Intracellular receptors** are receptor proteins that live floating directly in the [[cytoplasm|cytosol]] of cells, bind to [[signaling molecule#Lipid-Soluble Signaling Molecules|lipid-soluble ligands]] (that can pass directly through a [[plasma membrane|cell membrane]]). \n\nOnce bound with they ligand they form a complex called a **hormone-response element** or **HRE**. These can then be transported straight into the [[nucleus]] where they can [[gene expression]] directly.\n\n## Cell-Surface Receptors\n**Cell-surface receptors** are a type of receptor proteins that are also [[membrane proteins]]. They bind to [[signaling molecule#Lipid-Insoluble Signaling Molecules|lipid-insoluble molecules]], and relay (or *transduce*) the signal from there. In other words, signal transduction converts a extracellular message into an intracellular message. This method also is able to diversify or amplify the message for a greater effect, on things like [[gene expression]] even cause a direct change of the cytoplasmic protein activity.\n\n## Post-Synaptic Receptors\n**Post-synaptic receptors** are receptors that bind with [[neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]] that are released by the pre-synaptic neuron of a [[synapse]]. \n\nThere are many classes of post-synaptic receptors, based on what sort of neurotransmitter they receive. For example, [[sympathetic nervous system|adrenergic]] receptors such as [[sympathetic nervous system|alpha receptors]] or [[sympathetic nervous system|beta receptors]] receive [[epinephrine and norepinephrine]], and [[parasympathetic nervous system|cholinergic]] receptors receive [[acetylcholine]]. %%At least, I've *probably* understood that correctly%%\n\n___\n\n\n\n", "tags": ["Lipid"], "links": ["plasma membrane", "cytoplasm", "signaling molecule", "parasympathetic nervous system", "acetylcholine", "synapse", "sympathetic nervous system", "nucleus", "protein", "neurotransmitter", "gene expression", "epinephrine and norepinephrine", "membrane proteins"]}, {"title": "circulation", "text": "---\naliases: [pulmonary circuit, systemic circuit, portal vessel, anastomoeses, arterial anastomosis, venous anastomosis, arteriovenous anastomosis]\ntags: [cardiovascular, circulation]\nqueue: 4\nmemo: tidy up some\ndone: 6\n---\n# Circulation\n---\n**Circulation** refers to the movement of liquids around the body, specifically the [[blood]] and the [[lymphatic system|lymph]].\n\n**Pulmonary circulation** is the portion of the [[cardiovascular system]] that goes from the [[heart]] to the [[lungs]] and back again, oxygenating the [[blood]].\n\n**Systemic circulation** is the part of the [[cardiovascular system]] that brings oxygenated blood from the [[heart]] to the body's [[tissue|tissues]] and [[organ|organs]] and then back again.\n\n![[blood circulation.png]]\n\n**lymphatic circulation**\n\n\n## Alternate Pathways\nThe standard pathway is an artery leaves away from the heart, connects to a vein via a capillary, and then returns to the heart via a vein. There are several other arrangements that are found in various places around the body, depending on the system's needs.\n\n![[alternate blood vessels.png]]\n\n**Portal vessels** are any two blood vessels that are between two capillary beds. The biggest one in the body is the [[hepatic portal system]]. \n\n**Anastomoses** are a network of blood vessels, that join and diverge rather than go in a straight line. They can be **arterial anastomosis** or **venous anastomosis**, but for some reason venous anastomosis are more common. An **arteriovenous anastomosis** is a shunt, or a bypass that takes blood directly from the artery to the vein, without going through a capillary. These are used in places like the fingers, toes, ears etc. in order to prevent excessive heat loss in cold environments.

It's the broader view of how [[pathogen|pathogens]] or [[toxin|toxins]] move though and effect whole populations, and as such individuals are only looked at collectively. They search for causes of the disease, identify who is at risk, and determine how to control the spread or stop it alltogether. \n\n## Terminology\n**Incidence:** The number of *new cases* of a disease in a population at a specific point of time of over a specific time. Can be described as \"incidence rate\" or \"incidence proportion\"\n**Prevalence:** The *total number* of disease in a population at a specific time, or  over a specific time period. Can be described as \"point prevalence\" or \"period prevalence.\"\n\n**Morbidity:** The number of *new cases* of disease in a population.\n**Mortality:** The number of people who *die* from a disease within a population.\n\n**Endemic:** A disease that is always present within a population; usually at low levels, like a cold virus, or malaria\n**Epidemic:** An occurrence of an unusually high number of disease cases; for example when the flu spreads during winter months.\n**Pandemic:** A worldwide epidemic of a disease; for example [[COVID-19]]\n\n## Infectious Dose 50\n**Infectious dose 50**, or ID$_{50}$, is the dosage of a pathogen required to make 50% of a test population sick. The smaller the number, the more [[pathogen#Virulence|virulence]] the pathogen is. For example, if you take 10 mice, and inject 3ml of the pathogen into all of them, and 5 get sick, the ID50 for that pathogen is 3ml. \n\n## Koch's Postulates: Identifying The Cause of a Disease\n**Koch's postualtes** are a set of criteria that are used to determine of a particular pathogen is the cause of a particular disease. They are as follows:\n\n1. The microbe must be present in every case of the disease.\n2. The microbe must be isolated and grown in pure culture from disease hosts.\n3. The cultured microbe must cause the same disease when introduced to a healthy suseptible organism.\n4. The microbe must be reisolated from that orgamism and be identified as the same one.\n\nLooking especially at postualte 4 we can see it is a throrough set of criteria. In modern times it has been replaced by more sophisticated measures.\n\n### Molecular Koch's Postulates\n**Molecular Koch's postulates** are similar to Koch's regular postualtes, but they are used to identify a particular [[virulence|virulence factor]] of a disease. The criteria are as follows:\n\n1. The molecule must be present in all strains that cause disease.\n2. Mutating the gene for that molecule must decrease the [[virulence]] of the microbe.\n3. Restoring the gene must restore the microbe's virulence.\n\nSimilar to Koch's postulates, molecular Koch's postulates are very thorough.\n\n## Transmission of Disease\nThere are many ways that a disease can be transmitted. The common portals of entry for a pathogen are:\n- [[eyes]]\n- [[nose]]\n- [[gastrointestinal tract]]\n- [[respiratory tracts]]\n- [[genitourinary tract]]\n- broken [[skin]]\n\n### Disease Reservoirs\n**Disease reserviors** are the natural habitat of a [[pathogen]] *and* a potential continous source of disease. Simply being a place where the pathogen *is* isn't enough for it to be considered a reservior, the pathogen needs to be able to survive and reproduce there. There are three types of disease reservoirs, humans, non-human animals, and the environment.\n\n**Humans** themselves can be reservoirs, but it's important to understand that the human may or may not show signs or symptoms of the disease. For example, humans are a reservoir of [[HIV]].\n\nIf an **animal** is a reservoir it is called a **zoonose**\u2014or a disease that is mostly found in animals, but can be transmitted to people. For example, [[rabies]] is a zoonose.\n\nThe **environment** can be a reservoir as well. Some pathogens live in the soil or water, and can be transmitted to humans.\n\n### Vertical Transmission\n**Vertical transmission** is the transmission of a disease from mother to child, specifically when the baby is in utero, during childbirth, or during breastfeeding. If the disease is transmitted from mother to child, but it's done in any other way, this counts as [[#horizontal transmission]].\n\n### Horizontal Transmission\n**Horizontal transmission** is the transmission of disease in any way that is not [[#vertical transmission]].\n\n- *direct contact*\n- *indirect contact*\u2014through a *fomite*, or an inanimate object that can transfer disease, like a needle or doorknob.\n- *droplet*\u2014transmission between two people less than 1 meter apart\n- *airborne*\u2014transmission between two people more than 1 meter apart\n- *cross-contamination*\u2014of food or water\n- *vector transmision*\u2014when the pathogen lives in an insect, like in the plague, malaria, or lime disease.\n\n## Risk Factors of Disease\nA **risk factor** of a [[disease]] is something that influences how likely it is that someone will get that disease. The four general catagories for risk factors are:\n\n### Herd Immunity\n**Herd immunity** is when a large portion of a population becomes [[immunity|immune]] to a [[disease]] (either from previously contracting it and fighting it off, or through a [[vaccine]]), making the spread of the disease unlikely.\n\nBelow is a representation of three populations at varying levels of immunity. Note that there are only three infected hexes in each population, but the degree to which the population is vacinated varries.\n![[herd immunity before.png]]\n\nNow see how the infection has run it's course. In the 5% and 30% vaccinated population, the infection runs unchecked. In the 75% population however, the vast majority of the population reamins unaffected\u2014even those who remained unvaccinated.\n![[herd immunity after.png]]\n\n### General Health and Living Conditions\nThe types of living conditions that might increase the chance of getting the disease are malnutition or overcrowding.\n\n### Age\nThe very young do not have a fully developed immune system, and the old have a weakened immune system, as a consequence of aging. \n\n### Genetic Background\nSome people just have a natural advantage or disadvantage against certain pathogens. For example, [[HIV]] needs to bind to two different molecules to gain entry to our cells: CD4 and a particular type of chemokine receptor. Some people do not have that chemokine receptor, and are thus immune to HIV. \n\n## Identifying Risk Factors\nEpidemiologists can identify risk factors of a disease by performing either a retrospective study (looking back to see if there is a pattern), or a prospective study (following a group with the risk factor and a control to see if one has an increased occurence of the disease).", "tags": ["vertical", "horizontal", "Virulence"], "links": ["toxin", "eyes", "gastrointestinal tract", "skin", "HIV", "nursing", "nose", "immunity", "pathogen", "vaccine", "disease", "virulence", "respiratory tracts", "COVID-19", "rabies"]}, {"title": "nitrogen", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [chemistry, biology, respiratory]\n---\n# Nitrogen\n---\n**Nitrogen**\n\n\n\n\n___\n", "tags": [], "links": []}, {"title": "stage of development", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [psych]\n---\n# Stage of Development\n---\nThe **stages of development** are the different stages that we as humans go through, from the time we are born (even before!) to the time we reach late adulthood.

This prevents the tissues from receiving oxygen and nutrients, as well as carrying away cell waste. It can lead to [[tissue ischemia]] and [[cell death]]. This often occurs around bony protuberances such as the hips, heals and spine, when a patient has been immobilized for an extended period of time.\n\n[^1]: Since a stage 1 pressure injury is closed, it's not an \"ulcer\", so it's not technically accurate.\n\nPreventing the formation of pressure ulcers is something taken very seriously in [[nursing]]. \n\n>[!health] Q2 Turning\n>The current accepted rule of thumb for preventing pressure injuries on patients with a high risk of developing pressure injuries is turning the patient every two hours.\n\n## Contributing Factors\n- The **presence of moisture** increases the risk of skin breakdown, because if the skin is soaking up that water it becomes weaker and more prone to damage. This is *especially* true of the skin has lower pH, such as urine, and thus [[urinary incontinence]] is a really big risk factor for pressure ulcers.\n- A weak or absent **sensory perception** increases the risk of skin breakdown because a person would be unable to tell when they have been sitting in one position for an extended period of time. Usually sitting or laying in one position becomes uncomfortable and you'll voluntarily shift position. If you can't feel that it's becoming uncomfortable, it's hard to remember to move.\n- A reduced level of [[physical activity]] increases the risk of a pressure ulcer because activity, even just walking down the hall and back promotes good circulation, and is just really good for your tissues in general. \n- The level of a patient's **mobility** affects the risk of a pressure ulcer\u2014the less mobile they are the higher the risk. This is different from level of activity, because this refers to how capable a person is of moving themselves around. If a patient can roll over in bed on their own, they are likely to do so. If they can't\u2014be it due to lack of strength, sedation, or even the presence of restraints\u2014than they are more likely to be in one position for an extended period of time. Even sleeping people with good mobility turn themselves freely. \n- A patient's [[nutrition|nutritional status]], including their hydration, affects their risk for developing pressure ulcers because poorly fed cells are more easily damaged. Both dehydration and edema can impair circulation and contribute to pressure ulcer formation.\n- **How old** a patient is affects their risk for developing a pressure ulcer. One of the normal physiological changes as we [[older adult#Normal Physiologic Changes of Older Adults|age]] is our skin looses collagen and becomes thinner\u2014or more prone to injury.\n- **Friction** and **shear force** mechanical force that can damage the skin. Friction is something that is pretty noticeable, because it leaves an easily seen mark. Shear force is more devious, because it happens in the [[dermis]] when there are forces that pull the [[epidermis]] one way and the underlying [[connective tissue|fascia]] in opposite directions. \n\n## Stages\nPressure ulcers come in different stages, depending on their severity. They are stages I through IV, unstageable and deep pressure.\n\n- **Stage I** ulcers have discoloration of intact skin. This presents as an area of a **non-blanchable** bruise-like discoloration, typically over bony prominences. On lighter skin this can be black or red, and on darker skin it can be purple.\n- **Stage II** ulcers are \"partial thickness\" injuries, which means they have broken through the [[epidermis]] and exposes the [[dermis]]. The wound bed appears pink/red and moist. It might also present as an intact serum-filled blister. \n- **Stage III** ulcers are \"full thickness\" injuries, which means they have broken through the dermis, such that [[adipose tissue]] is exposed. Some [[slough]] or [[eschar]] may be visible.\n- **Stage IV** ulcers are also full thickness skin loss injuries, but it has extended deep enough to expose the underlying fascia, bone, tendons or ligaments. \n\n- **Unstageable** pressure ulcers those that have so much [[eschar]] or [[slough]] that it obscures the extent to which the area has been damaged.\n- **Deep pressure** is a pressure wound that goes all they way down to the dermis, and looks like a bruise but is non [[capillaries|blanchable]]. It goes all the way down to the bone. \n\n## Braden Scale\n1-4 points are combined for each subscale, and the lower the score the higher the risk.

Everything that can happen in biology can happen because of the physical properties of [[matter]], and how matter interacts with other matter. Of all the elements we know of, only 13 are really biologically important. Hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen are particularly important, making up 99% of our body's mass. Another 0.85% of the body's mass are sulfur, potassium, sodium, chlorine and magnesium. These  *love* making bonds with each other, and make all sorts of important molecular structures.\n\n### Molecular Shape\n[[molecule|Molecular shape]] is a very important concept in biology, because without complementary shapes, molecule binding could not occur.

Homeostasis is an unconsious thing (athough it *does* anticipate changes that we're conscious of), we can't control it, and we don't really think about it much. Allostasis does have an unconsious portion, but we can activly work to affect it.

You can think about the stressor, think about your responces to the stressor, and act them out. It also doesn't have to be reactive, but can involve anticipating needs and preparing to satisfy them before they arise.\n\n## Allostatic Load\nThe **allostatic load** is the cumulative psychological \"wear and tear\" that affects how you respond to stress. A higher allostatic load is associated with worse overall health, including chronic disease and premature death.

They are different from [[Gram positive bacteria]] bacteria because have a much *thinner* layer of [[peptidoglycan]] and a unique [[#outer membrane]] on top of the cell wall. The outer membrane of these bacteria protects them, and makes them generaly to treat than Gram positive bacteria.\n\n![[Gram negative bacteria.png]]\n\n### Outer Membrane\nThe **outer membrane** of Gram negative bacteria is a unique structure that is found outside the [[peptidoglycan]] layer. It is a bilayer, but where most bilayers found in biology are two layers of [[phospholipid|phospholipids]], the outer membrane only has *one* layer of phospholipids (the inside layers) and the other layer is made up of [[#lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS). Also found in the outer membrane are lipoproteins and porins.\n\n#### Lipopolysaccharides\n**Lipopolysaccharides** are found in the [[#outer membrane]] of Gram negative bacteria, and help the cell transport magnesium made up of two parts, *Lipid A* and *O-polysaccharide*, or *O-[[antigen]]*. \n\nBecause lipopolysaccharides can be deadly if they are released into the blood stream, they are also called \"[[toxin#Endotoxin|endotoxins]]\".\n\n![[lipopolysaccharide.png]]\n\n#### Porins\n**Porins** are [[membrane transport protein|membrane transport proteins]] that are only found in the [[#outer membrane]] of Gram negative bacteria. They have a unique 3 part shape. \n\n#### Lipoproteins\nBacterial **lipoproteins** are found in the [[#outer membrane]] of Gram negative bacteria and attach the outer membrane to the [[peptidoglycan]] layer. N.B.: This term is not to be confused with the lipid transporting vesicle [[lipoprotein|of the same name]], and sometimes referred to as \"proteolipid\" to avoid confusion. \n\n### Periplasm or Periplasmic Space\nThe **periplasmic space** is the area between the [[#outer membrane]] and the [[plasma membrane|cytoplasmic membrane]] of a Gram negative bacteria.\n\n## Gram Negative in the Lab\nWhen staining in the [[lab]], Gram positive bacteria retain Gram's iodine very well, so it can be washed away very easily and then stained with Safranin, turning them pink.\n___\n ", "tags": ["Endotoxin", "outer", "lipopolysaccharides"], "links": ["bacteria", "phospholipid", "peptidoglycan", "membrane transport protein", "plasma membrane", "Gram positive bacteria", "lab", "lipoprotein", "Gram stain", "antigen"]}, {"title": "type I hypersensitivity", "text": "---\naliases: [allergy, allergen, allergic reaction, desensitization, anaphylactic shock]\ntags: [biology, immune]\n---\n# Type I Hypersensitivities\n---\nA **type I hypersensitivity** is a [[hypersensitivity]] that involves the body making *way* too much [[antibody|IgE]]. This type of hypersensitivity is essentially what allergies are. \n\n![[type i hypersensitivity.png]]\n\n## Signs\nThe signs of a type I hypersensitivity reaction are:\n- [[hives]] (from a rush of fluids let in by [[#histamines]])\n- [[sneezing]] ([[#histamines]] serve as an irritant to the nerve cells in the nose)\n- congestion (from fluids filling up the surrounding vessels due to inflammation)\n- runny nose (from [[#histamines]] causing leakiness)\n- [[asthma]] (from [[#leukotrienes]] and [[#prostaglandins]])\n- specifically in bee venom reactions: massive swelling.\n\n### Anaphylactic Shock\n**Anaphylactic shock** is a very severe reaction that can happen if the allergen gets into the bloodstream. If that happens, the immune response causes things like:\n\n- constriction of bronchioles\n- sudden vasodilation and fluid loss\n- hypotensive shock and death\n\nThe treatment for anaphylactic shock is usually epinephrine.\n\n## Reaction\n### Sensitization\nThe **sensitization** portion of a type I hypersensitivity happens during the initial encounter with an allergen. [[B-cells]] encounter the allergen, which something it believes is an antigen, but is actually harmless, like pollen. It goes through the standard reaction it would go through with any other antigen. However, when it produces [[plasma cell|plasma cells]] they end up *over*producing the [[antibody|IgE antibody]].\n\nThese IgEs go to [[mast cells]] and [[basophils]] and completely coat them by binding to their [[antibody structure|Fc receptors]]. At this point a person is considered sensitized, because their mast cells and basophils are \"ready for action.\"\n\n![[mast and basophils with IgE.png]]\n\n### Cross-linking\nThe **cross-linking** portion of a type I hypersensitivity happens when the person encounters the same allergen that it has already been sensitized to. In order for an allergen to have an effect, it must cross-link the IgE antibodies on a single cell\u2014or bind to more than one IgE at the same time. The more IgEs present on the surface of the cell, the higher the likelihood of that happening.\n\n![[allergen cross-linking IgE.png]]\n\n### Release of Substances\nOnce crosslinked, the mast cells and basophils release their payloads. During an actual infection from pathogens, these would be helpful, but as it is we only experience the side-effects, or even break the brunt of their destructive power. This is especially true as the degranulation of mast cells and basophils are especially adept at destroying [[parasites]] that are too large to be phagocytized, like worms.\n\n#### Destructive Enzymes\nThe **destructive enzymes** that mast cells and basophils release are designed to destroy infectious bacteria. During a type I hypersensitivity reaction however, our own cells are potentially damaged instead.\n\n#### Histamines\n[[histamine|Histamines]] are released to loosen up the blood vessels and allow [[inflammation]].\n\n#### Prostaglandins\n**[[Prostaglandins]]** are substances released during a type I hypersensitivity. They do two main things: Firstly, they can attract more [[basophils]], which can then become cross-linked, causing a snowball effect; secondly, they can also cause [[smooth muscle|smooth muscles]]\u2014the muscles lining blood vessels and/or airways\u2014to constrict. The benefit of constricting smooth muscle is that ideally it would pump more white blood cells to the area, but in effect this causes allergy-related [[asthma]].\n\n#### Leukotrienes\n**[[Leukotrienes]]** are a substances released during a type I hypersensitivity. They can do two main things: firstly they can attract [[neutrophils]]; secondly, they can also cause [[smooth muscle|smooth muscles]]\u2014the muscles lining blood vessels and/or airways\u2014to constrict. The benefit of constricting smooth muscle is that ideally it would pump more white blood cells to the area, but in effect this causes allergy-related [[asthma]].\n\n## Treatments\nThere are two main treatments or management strategies for type I hypersensitivities, desensitization and the use of antihistamines. \n\n### Desensitization\n**Desensitization** is a treatment for type I hypersensitivities that works in about 80% of cases. The treatment works by exposing the person to the allergen in very low doses at first, then working up to higher and higher doses over the course of a very long time. The typical time frame for this type of treatment is 3-5 years. \n\nDesensitization works by having your body create plasma cells that have [[class switching|switched]] to producing [[antibody|IgG antibodies]] instead of [[antibody|IgE]]. If the system can coat the allergen with IgG before it has a chance to [[#Cross-linking|cross-link]] the mast cells or basophils, then there is no way for the reaction to occur.\n\n### Antihistamines\nThe use of **antihistamines** is more of a way to manage type I hypersensitivities than it is a treatment. How it works is the antihistamine is shaped closely enough to actual histamines that it can bind to the histamine receptors on the blood vessels, but is distinct enough that it does not trigger the same reaction. The main down-side to the use of antihistamines is that they degrade relatively quickly. \n\nOlder antihistamines would cause drowsiness because they could actually cross the [[brain|blood-brain barrier]], which mucked things up.\n\n___", "tags": ["leukotrienes", "histamines", "prostaglandins", "Cross"], "links": ["mast cells", "parasites", "neutrophils", "smooth muscle", "brain", "B-cells", "asthma", "hypersensitivity", "histamine", "inflammation", "class switching", "antibody structure", "plasma cell", "antibody", "basophils"]}, {"title": "tissue repair", "text": "---\naliases: [healing, wound, hemostasis, proliferation, granulation, angiogenesis, primary union, secondary union]\ntags: [biology, injury]\n---\n# Tissue Repair\n---\n**Tissue repair** happens after a physical [[injury]] to the [[tissue]].

This happens first through **vasoconstriction**, which tightens the vessels and reduces the blood flow through them. [[Platelets]] are drawn to the damaged area and release clotting factors to begin [[coagulation]] (or \"clotting\"), which turns the blood from a liquid to a gel. The platelets also allow the production of **fibrin** with makes a clot, which binds to any collagen in the surrounding tissue and pulls the edges of the wound together.\n\n### Inflammation\n[[Inflammation]] begins 5-10 minutes after the injury, bringing with it an influx of [[white blood cells|leukocytes]] and [[platelets]], as well as allowing damaged cell debris and toxins to be carried away. It is in this stage that a blood clot becomes a scab.\n\n### Proliferation\nThe **proliferation**, sometimes called the **granulation** phase is when the real meaty work of healing takes place. [[fibroblast|Fibroblasts]] make [[collagen]] and other components for the [[extracellular matrix|ECM]], new blood vessels are created in a process called **angiogenesis**, and the edges of a wide or deep wound are pulled closer together.   \n\n### Remodeling\nThe **remodeling**, sometimes called the **maturation** phase of healing [[collagen]] is oriented properly and the cells that have finished their duty undergo [[apoptosis]].\n\n## Primary & Secondary Union\n**Primary union** or **primary intention** is when the edges of the wound are close together, and can heal together. Sutures are recommended to promote a primary union and prevent the formation of a scar.\n\n**Secondary union** or **secondary intention** is when there is a gaping wound and the the space must be filled with a lot of cells and [[collagen]]\u2014which is left behind as a scar.\n___\n", "tags": [], "links": ["tissue", "bone repair", "fibroblast", "apoptosis", "platelets", "white blood cells", "collagen", "extracellular matrix", "coagulation", "injury"]}, {"title": "opsonin", "text": "---\naliases: [opsonization]\ntags: [biology, immune]\n---\n# Opsonin\n---\nAn **opsonin** is a protein in the [[immune system]] that binds to particles in a way that facilitates [[phagocytosis]], or other immune responces.\n\nOpsinization is the act of making those foreign particles more likely to be phagocotized, by coating it with opsonins.\n\n## Types\nThe main two types of opsonins are [[complement protein|complement proteins]] and [[antibody|antibodies]].\n\n## Opsonins and Capsules\nWhen a bacteria has the ability to make a [[capsule]], it can be problematic for the immune system because it effectivly hides any opsonin that may have attached to it.

The structure of a protein is very important and sensitive to change. Even a single amino acid missing or out of place can render the whole protein useless.\n\n## Primary Structure \nThe **primary structure** consists of one or more polypeptides. It's basically order of the amino acids connected in a line.\n\n## Secondary Structure\nThe **secondary structure** is formed automatically after the primary structure is formed. The peptide \"backbone\" forms [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonds]] with itself forming these shapes. Even though the hydrogen bonds are the weakest of bonds, but because there are so many of them, they can stay connected. That said, there are easily disrupted by changes in environmant (such as [[pH]], heat, salinity).\n\nIn many ways the secondary structure is the most important, because it is driven by the primary structure, yet held together by the weakest of bonds.\n\nThe three types of secondary sub-structures are *\u03b1-helixes*, *\u00df-pleated sheets*, and unstructured *random coils* that hold the other to together. \n\n**\u03b1-Helixes** are spiral shapes in the secondary structure.

These bonds are much stronger than the secondary structure bonds.\n\nit uses every type of chemical bond to form the terciary structure. The r-groups also bond together.

In these cases the **quaternary struture** is formed by multiple proteins, or subunits of the same protein bond together.\n\n[[Hemoglobin]] is an example of this, as it needs four hemoglobin proteins to form into it's proper shape.\n\n![[quaternary structure.png]]\n___\n", "tags": ["Special"], "links": ["hydrogen bond", "protein", "pH"]}, {"title": "gait", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: []\n---\n# gait\n---\n**gait**\n\nnormal\n\nweakened\n\nimpared\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___", "tags": [], "links": []}, {"title": "tubular reabsorption", "text": "---\naliases: [reabsorption, transport maximum]\ntags: [urinary]\n---\n# Tubular Reabsorption\n---\n**Tubular reabsorption** is a process that takes place in the [[nephron|nephrons]] where all the nutrients that were [[glomerular filtration|filtered]] out of the blood\u2014that we still very much want and do not want to get rid of\u2014are pulled back into the blood.\n\n**Step 1**: The filtrate that is produced during [[glomerular filtration]] enters the [[renal tubule]].\n\nStep 2: The filtrate is full of stuff we want to get rid of but also stuff we want to keep, like like [[glucose]] and [[electrolytes]].

It needs to be transported as a cotransporter, usually with [[sodium|Na+]]. Since there is only a certain amount of pumps for glucose, if there is too high a level of [[blood glucose]], (such as with [[diabetes mellitus]]), the [[#transport maximum]] can be met, and excess glucose is secreted in urine.\n\n## Sodium\nThe **reabsorption of sodium** largely effects the amount of water that is brought with it. [[sodium-potassium pump|Na+/K+ pumps]] keep the concentration gradient of sodium in the cell *low*\n\n## Water\nThe **reabsorption of water** has two components, obligatory water reabsorption that happens no matter what and facultative water reabsorption that can vary. **Obligatory water reabsorption** happens in the [[renal tubule|descending limb]] of the nephron loop, and this process happens *regardless of the overall state of hydration an individual is in*. **Facultative water reabsorption** happens in the collecting ducts, and it can be adjusted based on the individual's current state of hydration. If the individual currently needs to retain more water than what was reabsorbed during obligatory water reabsorption, then [[antidiuretic hormone|ADH]] is released, which triggers the insertion of [[channel proteins|aquaporins]] on the walls of the collecting ducts. This means more water is retained, and the urine is more concentrated. If the individual is sufficiently hydrated, or even over hydrated, ADH is not present, so no aquaporins are inserted in the collecting ducts, and any water that enters them is excreted in the urine.\n\n>[!science] Evolution and water scarcity\n>The kidneys naturally want to retain as much water as possible. Humans [[evolution|evolved]] in conditions where water was scarce, so it was beneficial to loose as little water as possible.\n\n## Transport Maximum\n**Transport maximum** is the maximum amount of a particular solute that can be reabsorbed (or secreted). Many solutes are transported back via active transport, which requires a transport protein specific to that molecule.

Rational numbers can always be expressed as [[fractions]] (where both numerator and denominator are integers and the denominator *is not equal to* 0), such as $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\n**Irrational numbers** are numbers that are infinate and non-repeating. For example, **\u03c0** is irrational because it just goes on forever and doesn't repeat itself for long enough to count. \u221a7 is irrational because 7 is not a perfect square (but \u221a25 is because 25 is a perfect square). \n\n## Order of Operations\nThe **order of operations** is like the grammar of math. It is a standardized order in which to perform mathematical operations in equations where there is more than one. The acronym for it is **PEMDAS**, or **P**arenthesis, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication/**D**ivision, **A**ddition/**S**ubtraction.\n\n## Fractions\nA [[fractions|fraction]] is a way of representing a part of a whole number.\n\n## Dimensional Analysis\n[[Dimensional analysis]] is a tool you can use to determine an equivalent value of something given in one unit, in another unit.

This makes more sense as anatomically this distinction is much more relevant than the state of the blood inside the veins.\n\n![[blood vessels.png]]\n\n- [[Arteries]] must withstand the pulsing [[blood pressure|hydrostatic pressure]] of the blood being pressed against the vessel walls. Therefore arteries both thicker and stiffer, and more than veins. This allows the vessels to expand during systolic pressure and relax during diastolic pressure.\n\n- [[Veins]] do not have nearly as much blood pressure pushing the blood through them, and thus have many features that help the blood actually move through them. Most notably they have internal valves that prevent the back flow of blood. \n\n- [[Capillaries]] are small specialized blood vessels that connect arteries and veins, while allowing fluids and nutrients in and out of the surrounding tissue.\n\n## The Great Vessels\n**Great vessels** are the large vessels that bring blood to and from the heart that are large pretty significant, and predictably located:\n\n- The **venae cavae** are two great vessels which empty into the [[heart|right atrium]].\n\t- The **superior vena cava** carries blood from the head, neck, arms and chest.\n\t- The **inferior vena cava** carries blood from the legs, feet and organs in the abdomen and pelvis.\n- The **pulmonary arteries** bring deoxygenated blood out of the [[heart|right ventricle]] and move it towards the lungs.\n- The **pulmonary veins** empty oxygenated blood into the [[heart|left atrium]].\n- The **aorta** brings all of the oxygenated blood out of the [[heart|left ventricle]] to the body.\n\n### Vasa Vasorum\nThe **vasa vasorum** are a small network of vessels that oxygenate the tissues of the larger blood vessels. (As far as I can find out they exist only really in the aorta and venae cavae, but I could be wrong there.)

Finally, (if it's a single stranded nucleic acid) the strand can be either [[nucleic acid|sense (+)]] or [[nucleic acid|antisense (-)]]. \n\n- **Nucleic Acid**\n\t- [[DNA]] *OR* [[RNA]]\n- **Strandedness**\n\t- single *OR* double\n- **Segmentedness**\n\t- segmented *OR* non-segmented\n- **[[nucleic acid#Sense Antisense -|Senseness]]**\n\t- sense *OR* antisense\n\t\nOne feature of viruses that use [[RNA]] as their nucleic acid is that, because RNA lacks a [[DNA mistakes#DNA Polymerase III Can Proofread|proofreading]] ability, it can mutate much more rapidly than DNA viruses. \n\t\n## Structure\nViruses are made up of [[#nucleic acids]] surrounded by a protective protein called a *capsid*. The capsid is made up of small protein subunits called *capsomeres*.\n\nThere are four basic shapes that they come in, helical, icosahedron, spherical, and complex. \n\n![[virus shapes.png]]\n\n**Helical viruses**, like the Tobacco Mosaic Virus, are overall cylindrical, with the proteins forming a helix on the exterior, and the nucleic acids also forming a helix inside..\n\n**Icosohedral viruses** like the Adenovirus are pretty simple, with 20 faces.\n\n**Spherical viruses** like the [[influenza|flu]] or [[COVID-19|Sars-CoV-2]] are, appropriately enough, spherical.\n\n**Complex viruses** are only seen as [[bacteriophage|bacteriophages]], and bacteriophages only ever take a complex shape. They are made up of three main parts, the head region where the nucleic acids are stored, the narrow body part down the middle, and those long creepy legs at the other end.\n\n## Enveloped Viruses\n**Enveloped viruses** are viruses which have an additional structure called an **envelope** along with something called a **matrix**. The envelope is made up of phospholipids (taken from it's previous host) and the matrix under the envelope and made up of proteins.\n\n![[enveloped virus.png]]\n\n## Types of Viruses\nAny and every cell has a virus that can infect it\u2014but the viruses themselves are *highly specific* to the type of cell they infect. If a virus happens upon a cell that isn't *its type*, it will bounce harmlessly off of it. It can even be the case for viruses which infect multicellular organisms being only able to enter *specific types* of that organisms cells.\n\n**[[bacteriophage|Bacteriophages]]** are viruses that infect bacteria. They are the only viruses that have the [[#complex]] shape, which they use to land on the outside of a bacteria and inject their genetic material directly into the cell.\n\n**[[animal virus|Animal viruses]]** are viruses that infect animal cells. They are much more likely to have an [[#envelope and matrix]], and enveloped viruses are more likely to be animal viruses. Unlike bacteriophages, they jump all the way into the cell wholesale.\n\n**Plant viruses** also exist.\n\n## Fighting Against Viruses\nIn addition to our [[immune system|immune system's]] own defense, we have developed different types of [[antivirals]] to fight against viral infections.\n\n## Viruses Aren't Even *Alive*\nThere is a current ongoing debate as to whether viruses are technically \"alive\" or not. The main reasoning for the statement that viruses are nonliving is that virus are non-cellular (one of the [[cell#Cell Theory|fundamental charactistics of life]]), and are unable to carry out any [[metabolism|metabolic]] process on their own (such as making ATP, or their own proteins). They cannot even *reproduce* without invading the cell of a living thing. Another reason for this definition as nonliving is that viruses lack agency. Viral particles simply carry out functions as they are \"pre-programed\" (this is evident when you consider the mechanism of [[horizontal gene transfer#Transduction|transduction]]).\n\n## How Did Viruses Evolve?\nHow viruses first evolved is essentially unknowable, but there are three basic hypotheses: the [[evolution of viruses#The Progressive Hypothesis|progressive]], the [[evolution of viruses#The Regressive Hypothesis|regressive]], and the [[evolution of viruses#The Virus-First Hypothesis|virus-first]] hypotheses.\n___\n", "tags": ["Sense", "Transduction", "complex", "The", "envelope", "DNA", "nucleic", "Cell"], "links": ["bacteria", "influenza", "nucleic acid", "RNA", "immune system", "ribosome", "bacteriophage", "pathogen", "DNA", "antivirals", "COVID-19", "animal virus", "metabolism"]}, {"title": "chemical bond", "text": "---\naliases: [Van der Waals interaction]\ntags: [chemistry]\n---\n# Chemical Bonds\n---\n**Chemical bonds** are lasting attractions between two or more [[atom|atoms]] or [[molecule|molecules]]. \n\nThe two main types of chemical bonds are **covalent**, and **ionic** bonds. **[[covalent bond|Covalent bonds]]** involve the *sharing* of electrons between two or more atoms. **[[ionic bond|Ionic bonds]]** involve the *transfer* of electrons from one atom to another. The resulting two ions are then strongly attracted to each other, forming a single molecule. It's a little counter-intuitive, but ionic bonds are actually *stronger* than covalent bonds, due to the sheer difference in charge between the two resultant ions.\n\n## Special Bonds\nStrictly speaking all bonds can be described in terms of covalent or ionic, but some are highly specific. \n\n**[[hydrogen bond|Hydrogen bonds]]** are an attraction between polar molecules and charged hydrogens.\n\n**Van der Waals interactions**, which are similar to hydrogen bonds in a way, but are between nonpolar molecules.\n\n**[[covalent bond#Glycosidic Bond|Glycosidic bonds]]** attach carbohydrates to other molecules.\n\n**[[covalent bond#Peptide Bond|Peptide bonds]]** join individual amino acids together.\n___\n\n", "tags": ["Peptide", "Glycosidic"], "links": ["hydrogen bond", "ionic bond", "molecule", "covalent bond", "atom"]}, {"title": "testes", "text": "---\naliases: [tunica vaginalis, spermatic cord, epididymis, vas deferens, seminiferous tubules, sustentacular cell]\ntags: [reproductive, male]\n---\n# Testes\n---\nThe **testes** (singluar: **testis**) is the primary organ of the [[male reproductive system]].

They are surrounded and protected by a [[serous membrane]] called the **tunica vaginalis**.\n\nThe testes are internally divided into ~250 **lobules** by partitions called **septa**. Inside these septa are up to four **seminiferous tubules**, which are very long and thin, and convoluted. Each seminiferous tubule contains **sustentacular cells** and germ cells called **spermatogonia**. These spermatogonia become sperm through [[sperm|spermatogenesis]]. Squished in between the seminiferous tubules are the **interstitial cells**, which do many fun things like secrete [[testosterone]].\n\nThe seminiferous tubules all empty out into more centrally-located tubules called the **rete testis**, which then empty into the **epiddymis**, which covers the superior and posterior surfaces of the testes. Internally, the epididymis contains a very long, convolute duct that stores sperm until they are fully mature and motile.\n\nMature [[sperm]] stay there until they're ejacutlated, when they exit out of another tube called the **vas deferens**, sometimes called the **ductus deferens**. These sperm cannot swim yet, so the vas deferens uses [[peristalsis]] to move them along.

The membrane of a cell is anchored to the [[cytoskeleton]] on the inside that helps keep it's shape, and most cells also excrete products that are assembled into the [[extracellular matrix|ECM]] just beyond the membrane. \n\nMembranes are vitally important not only because they protect the cell and keep all the bits in one place, but also because they separate out different enzymes, proteins and nutrients that they need from the environment. In other words, they can allow and control different, separate micro-environments in and out of a cell.\n\nThere are several important [[plasma membrane]] that can vary between the domains Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya, such as what type of phospholipid link is present, or what type of inclusions are found in them.\n\n## Phospholipid Bilayers\nA **phospholipid bilayer** is two layers of [[phospholipid|phospholipids]] that have their hydrophobic tails touching and their hydrophilic heads pointing out. Almost every membrane in biology is formed of **bilayers**, and they are usually\u2014but not always\u2014the phospholipid sort. \n\n## Membrane Proteins\n[[Membrane proteins]] are proteins that are stuck a membrane are amphipathic, so they can integrate into lipid bilayers. The part that is inside the membrane is hydrophobic, and the part on the outside of the membrane is hydrophilic. \n\n![[plasma membrane.png]]\n\n## Membrane Transport\n[[Membrane transport]] is the act of regulating the flow of particles across  a membrane barrier. This is how cells acquire the nutrients they need and expel the waste they don't want, or secrete the proteins that they will use to build their extracellular environment.\n\n### Permeability\nLipid bilayers are **selectively permeable**, meaning that some substances cross the membrane at a higher rate than others. Small, nonpolar molecules cross the membrane quite readily, but the larger and more charged molecule or ion is the slower it can move across it.\n\n![[permeability of substances.png]]\n\nCharacteristics of the membrane itself also effect permeability. Membranes with shorter, straight [[fatty acids|unsaturated fatty acid]] tails allow more, bigger, and more highly charged molecules and ions through them. Membranes with long, kinky [[fatty acids|saturated fatty acid]] tails are more tightly packed together and do not allow as much through.\n\n![[permeability of plasma membrane.png]]\n\nTo get molecules across membranes at a faster rate than would happen naturally, cells can use [[membrane transport#Facilitated Diffusion|facilitated diffusion]] or even [[membrane transport#Active Transport|active transport]].\n\n### Permeability Buffs & Debuffs\nThere are certain factors that can increase or decrease a given membrane's permeability.\n\nKinks in the fatty acids of the phospholipids due to the being more or less \"saturated\". When they are saturated they are rigid and less permeable, when they are unsaturated they are more oily and less permeable. Different organisms and cell types make different types of fatty acids to put into their biological membranes. \n\n[[Cholesterol]] can also effect the permeability of a membrane by reducing it. This happens because it smooshes the hydrocarbon tails of the phospholipids together. \n\nAt high temperatures the presence of cholesterol *decreases* the permeability of membranes by filling spaces in the hydrophobic layers of the lipid tails. It sits between the spaces in the unsaturated fats, and fills hydrophobic space in the biological membrane. A helpful analogy is adding cholesterol to a membrane is like putting drywall putty on a mesh.\n\n## Detergents and Their Effects on Membranes\n**Detergents** disrupt biological membranes by interacting with hydrophobic tails of phospholipids. For cleaning, it disrupts bacterial membranes that might be living in your kitchen, bathroom, underwear etc.\n\n# Differences in Plasma Membranes Structure Across Domains\n---\nThere are several important characteristics of the plasma membrane that can vary between the domains Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya.\n\n## ATP Synthase Location\n**[[ATP synthase]]** is found in prokaryotes' cytoplasmic membranes, but eukaryotes have it in the mitochondrial membrane.\n\n## Rigidity/Fluidity Modifier Molecule\nIn order to be effective, membranes generally need to have a molecule that helps maintain it's fluid structure. If it's too rigid, nothing can move in or out.\n\n**Eukaryotes** use [[sterol|sterols]] like cholesterol as a fluidity modifier. **Bacteria** on the other hand use a class of molecule called *hopanoids*. \n\n## Esters vs Ethers\nThe [[phospholipid|phospholipids]] that make up the membrane bilayer is made up of a head and tail region.\n\nBoth bacteria and eukaryotes use **ester linkage** to connect their phospholipd head and tail. Ester links are identifiable by the double bonded oxygen off the carbon atom. (Try to remember this with STOp, or e**ST**er=**Op**)\n\n![[ester.png]]\n\nArchaea use an **ether linkage** to connect their phospholipid head and tail. Ether linkages are identifiable by their lack of double bonded oxygen.\n\n![[ether.png]]\n\n## Phospholipid Tails\nThe differences between different organism in terms of the *tails* of their [[phospholipid#Hydrophobic Tail|phospholipids]] come down to qualities that archaea have that bacteria and eukaryotes do not have.\n\nBacteria and eukaryotes both have single chains of carbons, but (some) [[archaea]] will have offshoots along their phospholipids.

They can be \nbut are not necessarily all the same shape of gland.\n\n### Lobes & Acini\n**Acini** are clusters of cells within the gland that exist within the overall gland. The acini are surrounded by a **lobe**. (This has been explained poorly, I think I'm missing something.)  \n\n## Secretion Mechanisms\nExocrine glands can secrete their substances one of three ways, by **merocrine**, **apocrine** or **holocrine** secretion.\n\n![[exocrine gland mechanisms.png]]\n\n**Merocrin secrition** is the most common mechanism, and it works by enclosing the substance in a secretory [[vesicle]] and then bringing that vesicle to the apical wall and mushing it out by [[endocytosis and exocytosis|endocytosis]]. An example of this is [[salivary glands]].\n\n**Apocrine secretion** is similar to merocrine secretion but instead creating vesicles and then merging them with the cell wall, a whole segment of the cell just pinches off and flies free. Once it does that the cell can continue rebuild and go on producing more secretions. An example of this is [[mammary glands]].\n\n**Holocrine secretion** is when the whole gland cell pops free and then bursts open, releasing it's contents. New cells have to be grown to replace those lost. One way to identify a secretion has come from a holocrine mechanism is the presence of cellular material, such as DNA, RNA, or phospholipids.

Essentially, as one changes, the other changes the other direction.\n$$\nP_1V_1=P_2V_2\n$$\nIt can also be expressed as \"volume is inversely proportional to pressure\" ($V\\propto\\frac{1}{P}$), or even \"pressure multiplied by volume is equal to some constant, *k*\" ($PV=k$).\n\n### Charles' Law\n**Charle's Law** states that when the pressure and amount of gas remain constant, there is a positive correlation between volume and temperature. Essentially, as one changes, the other changes in the same direction.\n$$\n\\frac{V_1}{T_1}=\\frac{V_2}{T_2}\n$$\nIt can also be expressed \"volume is directly proportional to temperature\" ($V\\propto T$), or \"volume equals some constant, y, multiplied by temperature\" ($V=yT$)\n\n### Avogadro's Law\n**Avogadro law** states that when temperature and pressure are constant, equal volumes of any gas contain the same number of molecules. Essentially, the more atoms of a gas there are, the volume increases, and vice versa.\n$$\n\\frac{V_1}{n_1}=\\frac{V_2}{n_2}\n$$\nIt can also be expressed as \"the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of [[mole|moles]] present in the sample\" ($V\\propto n$), or \"volume equals some constant, *k*, multiplied by amount of gas\" ($V=kn$)\n\n### Ideal Gas Law\nThe **ideal gas law** is the combination of all three gas laws, using the gas constant **R**.

Anthropologists have found evidence of broken bones that had fully healed in archaeological sites 15,000 years-old! Somebody had to have taken care of that poor injured person long enough for them to have their bone heal. Some anthropologists consider this the first sign of human civilization.\n\nNursing has been around in some form or another in just about every culture and civilization that has existed\u2014but nursing as a profession in and of itself did not come about until the 1850/60s when [[influential nurses|Florence Nightingale]] formalized the discipline of nursing and opened the Nightingale college of Nursing.\n\n## What Makes Nursing a Profession?\nA **profession** is an occupation that requires prolonged training, formal qualification, and has participants who adhere to [[ethics|ethical]] standards.

In addition to this nursing...\n\n- has a well-defined [[nursing theory|body of specific and unique knowledge]].\n- has a strong service orientation.\n- has recognized authority as a professional group.\n- has professional organizations (i.e. the ANA) that sets standards.\n- performs ongoing [[nursing research|research]].\n- has autonomy and practices self-regulation.\n\n## Nursing vs Medicine\nTraditionally the role of nurses was strictly to support and assist [[provider|doctors]] in taking care of their patients. While this is still true, modern nursing is much more autonomous and acts more in parallel with doctors to provide care for the patient. Nursing outcomes are different from medical outcomes. Doctors are more focused on treating any underlying problems or disease a patient has, and nurses are more focused on treating the effects that the problems or disease have on a patient.

Because there is an inevitable shortening of the gene's [[telomere|telomeres]] there is a finite number of cell divisions possible before irrevocable data loss in the DNA occurs.\n\n## Normal Physiologic Changes of Older Adults\nIt is important to recognize the normal physiologic changes in older adults so you can recognize when something is out of the ordinary, and should be investigated further.

The older adult may continue to engage in all activities of middle age but intuitively adjusts to a modified pace and more frequent rest periods.\n\n>[!tip]- SPCES Assessment\n>A **SPICES assessment** should be done at a regular interval when caring for an older adult, because it addresses the risks associated with normal signs of aging.

The body produces less [[collagen]] and [[elastic fiber|elastin]], which reduces flexibility in almost every system; and the body looses [[skeletal muscle|muscle mass]].\n\n### Integumentary System\nAs we age the [[skin]] becomes thinner and less firm. There are a reduced number and activity of the [[stem cell|stem cells]], which means skin repair slows and there is simply less of it. This is why old people are cold more often. This also means they have less protection from trauma.\n- Thin skin hinders [[thermoregulation]], and can cause older people to feel cold.\n- Less elasticity causes wrinkling and sagging of skin.\n- Dryness and scaling are common.\n- There are fewer skin-based [[dendritic cells]].\n- Changes to [[hair|hair follicles]] produce thinner hair\u2014or none at all. Balding becomes common in men, though women also experience thinning of hair. Additionally the hair loses pigmentation.\n- Skin pigmentation and moles are common, although the skin may become pale because of loss of [[melanocytes]].\n- [[Nails]] typically thicken, becoming brittle and yellowed.\n- The blood vessels in the dermis become more fragile, causing increased bruising and purpura (hemorrhaging into the skin).\n\n### Musculoskeletal System\nAs we age we see a decrease in [[skeletal muscle|muscle mass]], [[hypodermis|subcutaneous tissue]], and [[body weight]]. Thus strength diminishes. [[joint|Joints]] tend to stiffen and lose flexibility, and range of motion may decrease. Overall mobility commonly slows, and posture tends to stoop. Height may decrease 1 to 3 inches.\n\n- [[Bone remodeling]] starts to favor resorption, so our bones become porous and brittle due to demineralization (of [[calcium]]), and the loss of organic material (specifically [[collagen]]).\n\t- If [[osteoporosis]] develops, [[bone repair|fracture]] is more common.\n\n#### Teeth\n- Tooth decay and loss continue for most older adults.\n- Eating habits may change, particularly if the older adult lacks teeth or has ill-fitting dentures.\n\n### Neurologic System\n- The central nervous system responds more slowly to multiple stimuli.\n\t- Hence, the cognitive and behavioral response of the older adult may be delayed.\n- Rate of [[reflexes|reflex response]] decreases.\n- Temperature regulation and pain/pressure perception become less efficient.\n- There may be a loss of sensation in the extremities.\n- The older adult may also experience difficulty with balance, coordination, fine movements, and spatial orientation, resulting in an increased risk for falls.\n- Sleep at night typically shortens, and the older adult may awaken more easily. Catnaps become common.\n\n#### Special Senses\n- Diminished visual acuity ([[eye assessment|presbyopia]]) occurs, with increased sensitivity to glare, decreased ability to adjust to darkness, decreased accommodation, decreased depth perception, and decreased color discrimination. Cataracts may further obscure vision. As a result of these changes, the older adult may have difficulty reading small print, and daytime or night driving maybe compromised.\n- Diminished hearing acuity ([[ears#Problems with The Ear|presbycusis]]) occurs, particularly diminished pitch discrimination in the presence of environmental noises. Cerumen (wax) buildup is common. As a result of hearing problems or amplification issues with hearing aids, the older adult may withdraw from social events.\n- The senses of taste and smell are decreased. Sweet and salty tastes diminish first. Sensitivity to odors may be reduced. Problems with nutrition may result.\n\n### Psychological Changes of Older Adults\nAccording to Erikson's psychosocial theory, older adults are wrestling with.\n [[psychosocial theory|ego integrity vs. despair]]. This means older adults\n\nThere is a perception that older adults are just get forgetful and disoriented, and loose their mental faculties just as a natural process of aging. This is a myth! There is some reduction in processing speed and mental agility, but significant changes are unexpected and warrant investigation. There are three main causes behind neurocognitive disruptions in older adults: **depression**, **delirium**, and **dementia**.\n\n#### Depression\n[[Depression]] is the most common psychological condition in older adults, though it is not necessarily a normal or expected part of aging. Older adults retire from their careers, have lost their spouses or friends or family\u2026or even loose their own health or fear their own death. These are really heavy emotional problems, and it can be a real struggle to maintain their emotional homeostasis. Additionally, physiological [[sensory deficit|losses of senses]] like hearing may make someone think there is a cognitive change, when they might just be [[confusion|confused]].\n\n#### Delirium\n[[Delirium]] is a common psychological condition in older adults, because a lot of the risk factors for delirium have older age as a risk factor, such as new medications, hospitalization, or infection.\n\n#### Dementia\n[[Dementia]] is most common in older adults, but not a natural cause of aging. Multiple different disease processes can cause it, and it's characterized by a gradual onset and loss of cognitive ability.\n\n### Cardiopulmonary System\n- Blood vessels become less elastic and often rigid and tortuous. Venous return becomes less efficient. Fatty plaque deposits continue to occur in the linings of the blood vessels. Lower-extremity edema and cooling may occur, particularly with decreased mobility. Peripheral pulses are not always palpable. Orthostatic hypotension can occur.\n- The body is less able to increase heart rate and cardiac output with activity.\n- Pulmonary elasticity and ciliary action decrease, so that clearing of the lungs becomes less efficient. Respiratory rate may increase, accompanied by diminished depth.\n\n### Gastrointestinal System\nMany of the normal physiological changes in an older adult affect their nutrition. There is a general decrease in [[basal metabolic rate|BMR]] and [[physical activity]], which leads to less energy expenditure, and thus less of a caloric need.

As it becomes a tertiary follicle, the center of the follicle enlarges and fills with fluid, and the oocyte is pushed to one side.

During alveolar gas exchange, [[oxygen]] moves into the depleated, deoxyginated blood in the respiratory [[capillaries]], and at the same time [[carbon dioxide]] leaves the bloodstream and is released into the air inside the lungs to be exhaled.\n \n![[alveolar gas exchange.png]]\n\n## Oxygen\n[[Oxygen]] is increadably valuable, and an interruption of it's supply to our cells is one of the quickest way to [[cell death]]. And we not only need it, but we need a *lot* of it *all the time*. Fortunately for us, oxygen is just all around, floating in the air for free. [[breathing|Pulmonary ventilation]] brings air into the lungs from the surrounding atomsphere, and the oxygen that is present in the air diffuses through the [[alveoli#Respiratory Membrane|respiratory membrane]] of the alvioli into the bloodstream.\n\nThis is where the chemistry starts. According to [[partial pressure#Gasses in Solution|Henry's law]], the solubility of a gas is dependent upon its [[partial pressure]] as well as its *solubility coefficient*...and oxygen has a really high solubility coefficient. This makes it near impossible for oxygen to dissolve into blood plasma\u2014because of this only about 2% of transported oxygen is disolved directly into the plasma. The remaining 98% of the oxygen then passes into red blood cells and binds to [[hemoglobin]], making **oxyhemoglobin**. Each molecule of hemoglobin can carry 4 oxygen molecules, and each redblood cell carries ~270 million hemoglobins! The heme molecule's strong affinity for oxygen makes up for oxygens's high solubility coefficient. Certain conditions affect how easily the oxygen can bind, as described in the [[oxygen-hemoglobin saturation curve]].\n\n## Carbon Dioxide\n[[Carbon dioxide]] picked up in the tissues is expelled when it reaches the respiration memebrane. Some CO$_2$ (10%) is disolved directly into the plasma, and this simply diffuses out. Another 20% is bound to [[hemoglobin]], which simply dissasociates and diffuses out.\n\nThe remaining 70% of CO$_2$ is transported in the bloodstream in the form of [[bicarbonate]] (HCO$^-_3$). In order to get the carbon dioxide out of bicarbonate, first we need to convert it into [[carbonic acid]], which it does when it reacts with a free floating [[hydrogen ion]]. Carbonic acid is weak acid that is pretty unstable, and only lasts for a short time before dissasociating into carbon dioxide and water (or even going back to become bicarbonate again). Taht carbon dioxide is then free to difuse out of the respiration membrane to be exhaled. \n\nThe chemical reaction from carbonic acid to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O is, on it's own, quite slow. The enzyme [[carbonic acid|carbonic anhydrase]] can be used to drastically speed up the process, and *that* is found inside the [[red blood cells]]. So while some bicarbonate does all of that reaction in the plasma, some of it enters into the RBC through a process called **reverse chloride shift** (where a [[chloride|Cl-]] ion is yote from the RBC) and the same reaction happens there at a much faster rate due to the presence of carbonic anhydrase.\n\n## Partial Pressures\nBefore the alveolar gas exchange happens the blood is \"deoxygenated\":\nThe PO$_2$ in the deoxygenated blood is 40 mmHg\nThe PCO$_2$ in the deoxygenated blood is 45 mmHg\n\nAfter the alveolar gas exchange the blood is \"oxygenated\":\nThe PO$_2$ in the oxygenated blood is 100 mmHg (technically it's 104)\nThe PCO$_2$ in the deoxygenated blood is 40 mmHg\n\n___", "tags": ["Respiratory", "Gasses"], "links": ["partial pressure", "capillaries", "breathing", "oxygen", "carbonic acid", "chloride", "alveoli", "respiratory system", "bicarbonate", "hydrogen ion", "oxygen-hemoglobin saturation curve", "red blood cells", "carbon dioxide", "hemoglobin"]}, {"title": "somatic nervous system", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [biology, a&p, nervous]\n---\n# Somatic Nervous System\n---\nThe **somatic nervous system** is the part of the [[peripheral nervous system]] that relays voluntary motor signals from the [[central nervous system|CNS]] to [[skeletal muscle]] in order to produce voluntary motion.

The smaller version uses the *-ous* suffix and the larger uses the *-ic* suffix. For example, iron can form Fe$^{2+}$ or Fe$^{3+}$, so these would be *ferrous* and *ferric* respectively.

These viruses are very likely to have be [[virus#Envelope and Matrix|enveloped]]. Although most viruses can only infect a single species, and some even more specialized viruses can infect a single tissue type, some viruses like rabies can infect multiple species.\n\nNotable animal viruses: [[COVID-19|Sars-CoV-2]], [[HIV]]\n\n## Entry Into a Cell\nUnlike [[bacteriophage|phages]] that just inject it's genetic material into a cell and nothing else, animal viruses need to enter it's prospective host cell wholesale. There are two ways a virus can do this, via membrane fusion or by inducing endocytosis.\n\nEither method of entry require the virus to properly bind to the animal cell's [[receptors|receptor protein]]. Regardless of method used, once inside the cell it sheds it's capsule and releases it's nucleic acid.\n\n### Membrane Fusion\n**Membrane fusion** is a way for an enveloped animal virus to enter a host cell my merging it's phospholipid membrane with the host cell's [[plasma membrane|phospholipid membrane]]. \n\n![[animal virus membrane fusion.png]]\n\n### Induced Endocytosis\n**Induced endocytosis** is a way for an animal virus to enter a host cell by attaching to a food particle\n\n![[animal virus endocytosis.png]]\n\n## Inside the Cell\nOnce the animal virus has entered the cell, it is time for it to replicate it's nucleic acid and make new particle. Depending on the type of nucleic acid that the virus uses, the number and order of steps can vary. \n\n## Release From a Cell\nOnce the new virions have been produced and assembled, they must leave the host cell. Some animal cells can lyse open their host cell, just like phages, but most (but not all) enveloped viruses leave by a process called budding, which incidentally give them their envelope.\n\n### Budding\n**Budding** is a way for enveloped animal viruses to leave their host cell after maturation. Basically, the virion goes up to the inside of the membrane, and just pushes and pushes until it pops out, complete with a section of the host cell's membrane that is now the virus's envelope.\n\n![[animal virus budding.png]]\n\n## Acute vs Persistent Infections\nThere are two types of infections from animal viruses, differentiated by the severity of the symptoms and the length of infection.\n\n### Acute Infection\n**Acute** [[infection]] from an animal virus are relatively sudden and severe, but are generally short lived. In these infections, many new viral particles are created and do extensive damage. The good news is the [[immune system]] can attack the viral particles, but the bad news is that usually involves destroying the cell in the process, because they go after them when they're still inside.\n\n### Persistent Infection\n**Persistent infection** from an animal virus might not have as sudden or severe symptoms as an acute infection (if any!), but they can last a really long time. For example, the herpes virus can do both persistent and acute infections. When it's in it's persistent cycle, it goes to nerve cells to just hide away in the cytoplasm. Then certain stresses can make it move to skin cells and start an acute infection.\n\nThere are two ways a persistent animal virus can hide away in a cell. One, like the herpes virus, can just enter into the [[cytoplasm]] of a cell and hang out without replicating. The other is to integrate into the host cell's DNA, like [[HIV]].\n\n#### Chronic vs Latent Persistent Infections\n**Chronic** and **latent** are the two ways that persistent infections can occur. In chronic infections there is a continuous production of low levels of new virus particles. These may or may not present symptoms, but can still transmit the virus. In latent infections, the viral genomes spends some time inactively, either in the chromosomal DNA or separately like a plasmid. This genome is called a \"provirus\". \n\n## Animal Viruses May Change the Behavior of Their Host Cell\nSome animal viruses can change the behavior of their host cell.

Cyclic GMP (active form of GMP) keeps the gate constantly open. \n\n#### In the light\nWhen the light strikes the photo receptor at the visual pigment (which is made up of retinol and opsin = rhodopsin) the light makes that rhodopsin break (because the retinal changes shape) and the opsin activates **phosphodiesterase**. This converts cyclic GMP (a [[second messengers|second messenger]]) into GMP (the inactive form), which...closes the gate that lets Na+ and K+ which hyperpolarizes the PR, which lets it stop releasing glutamate, which allows the *bipolar* neuron to release glutamate which is actually excitatory in this case towards the ganglion cell. \n\n(Phosphodiesterase always deactivates [[second messengers]].)\n\n>[!important] You constantly breaking and making new rhodopsin\n>  Every time a photoreceptor fires, it breaks the rhodopsin, and you need to make another one.

This includes a wide range of activities like laughing, crying, cursing, exercise, smoking, drinking or social withdrawal. \n\nCoping is a process, not an event. You can prefer different coping styles or mechanisms, but using a variety is best. Flexibility is much more helpful than rigidity. Coping mechanisms are generally useful in the short term, but if used too much can become a problem in and of themselves. For example, it can lead to excessive drinking, smoking, or withdrawal from support systems.\n\n**Problem-focused** or **task-oriented** reactions are used when a person consciously thinks about the *source* or their stress or anxiety and work to resolve it. This can be like asking for support, creating a to-do list and working on time-management. People generally use these when stressor is perceived as changeable. It can be further broken down into attack, withdrawal, or compromise behavior.\n- **Attack behavior** is when a person attempts to overcome some obstacle straight on. It can be constructive, but it can also be aggressive or hostile.\n- **Withdrawal behavior** is when a person physically or emotionally withdraws from the situation. They may just admit defeat and/or become apathetic.\n- **Compromise behavior** is usually constructive, and is when someone substitutes goals, or negotiates to partially fulfill a need.\n\n**Emotion-focused** reactions are coping mechanisms that a person uses to fix how they feel, not the \nproblem itself. Stuff like [[exercise]], taking a relaxing bath, meditating, etc. People generally use these types of mechanisms when the stressor is perceived as unchangeable. \n\nA **meaning-focused** reactions work to change the meaning of the stressor in someone's mind. For example, going from thinking a devastating illness is an unfair punishment to thinking of it as a challenge to overcome. This type of coping mechanism is less common than emotion or task oriented mechanisms.\n\n## Ego Defenses\n**Ego defenses** are a subset of coping mechanisms that someone subconsciously uses to protect their ego. Sometimes they can be healthy, but they are often destructive, immature or unhealthy behaviors. Some are simple, like acting out or denial. Some are a bit more complex.\n\n- **Regression** is when one reverts to age-inappropriate behaviors from when they were younger.\n- **Fixation** is similar to regression, but the individual never outgrows the childish behaviors in the first place.\n- **Displacement** is when one \"takes out\" their frustrations on someone or something else--usually someone or something they have power over. \n- **Identification** is like displacement, and it's when someone takes on the behaviors of their childhood aggressor in adulthood.\n- **Projection** is when you accuse others of your own misbehavior.\n- **Rationalization** is making excuses for your own behavior. \n- **Reaction formation** is when your actions are different from your feelings.\n\t- One example is if you're in an abusive relationship, but instead of dealing with that you convince yourself you're really in love with your abuser.\n\t- Another example is when you have a really ornery, annoying patient, but you plaster on a super polite friendly personality to deal with it.\n- **Repression** is involuntarily forgetting a traumatizing event.\n- **Disassociation** is a temporary, drastic change in personality to deal with an acute stressor.\n- **Suppression** is actively and *temporarily* pushing back thoughts on a topic. This is usually pretty healthy and mature, but only if you can unsuppressed at a certain point.\n\t- For example, avoiding ruminating on a test score until after the scores have been posted. \n- **Isolation of affect** is when someone separates, or compartmentalizes their feelings from reality. I think it's sort of like if suppression goes too far.\n\t- Like a soldier after violent combat, who can talk about it as if it were nothing.\n- **Intellectualization** is when someone uses facts to cover for dealing with their feelings.\n\t- For example, if someone has a bad diagnosis and are asked how they are doing, they might just give stats and figures and reports instead of actually answering.\n- **Sublimation** is a mature ego defense where someone uses their bad feelings in one area and channels it into another, productive area.\n- **Altruism** is a mature ego defense where someone focuses on helping others.\n- **Humor** can also be a mature ego defense.\n\n\n#flashcard \nwhat are the three (3) different types of focuses for **coping mechanisms**\n::\n**meaning**-focused\n**problem**-focused\n**emotion**-focused\n<!--SR:!2022-12-19,11,190-->\n\n___", "tags": ["flashcard"], "links": ["burnout", "stress", "anxiety", "exercise"]}, {"title": "neurological assessment", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [nursing, nervous]\n---\n# Neurological Assessment\n---\nA **neurological assessment** is an [[assessment]] of the [[nervous system]]. \n\nPNS:\n\t12 cranial nerves (memorize these)\n\t31 pairs of spinal nerves\n\n## Subjective Data\nHeadaches?

From the beginning to the end of this stage in life there are huge, marked changes, especially in physical size, brain development, and the acquisition of [[motor skills]].\n\n## Physical Characteristics\n**Newborns grow at a phenomenal rate**. Although they loose a few ounces in the first three days, they then start gaining weight steadily. By 4 months, they are twice their birthweight, and by one year they have *tripled it*. By 1 years old the baby is generally 25 cm taller, and by two months old they've gained another 10 cm. By the time a child is two years old, they have reached **half of their adult height**, and typically weigh from about **10 to 14 kilograms**.\n\n![[weight chart ages 0-2.png]]\n\n### Brain Growth\nThe [[brain]] is the *fastest growing organ* from week 2 after conception to when a child is two years old. It is the last organ to be affected by temporary (or not temporary) [[malnutrition]], which is called **brain-sparing**.\n\nBaby's brains have many more neurons than are needed, but they are quite simple, lacking the amount of [[neurons|dendrites]], [[synapse|synapses]] and [[myelination|myelin]] than we see in adults. This means there there is a lot of *potential* to grow and make connections, but neural signals to propagate much more slowly. Neurons multiply and form synapses at a fantastic rate, and also \"prune\" away unneeded, or unused synapse as well, processes called [[transient exuberance and pruning]].\n\nCertain regions of the brain develop faster than others. For example, babies almost completely lack a [[cerebrum|prefrontal cortex]] (in fact, it doesn't fully develop until about age 25), which means that, if a baby is upset, it cries, and it can't just decide to stop crying. \n\n#### Experience Expectant or Dependent Growth\n**There are some ways that all babies will develop**, given the normal, regular interaction that\u2014ideally\u2014everyone everywhere gives babies. This is called **experience-expectant growth**. Babies see things and people, interact with there environment, hear spoken language, play. Without these *expected* experiences their development is hindered drastically.\n\nThere are also ways that not all babies will develop, and these are dependent on other very specific things that any particular baby may or may not experience. This is called **experience-dependent growth**. In other words, depending on if babies experience something (for example, hearing a particular pronunciation in spoken language), then they will develop that ability\u2014if they don't experience it, that's fine, no necessary development suffers from it. \n\n### Sleep\n**Newborns [[sleep]] a ton**, and gradually start needing less and less sleep as they get older.\n\nAt first a baby sleeps more than **half the day**\u2014something like 15-17 hours a day\u2014but it's broken up into 1-2 hour stretches. It takes babies about 3 months to sleep through the night (i.e. sleeping 6-8 uninterrupted hours.) By the time they are 1 or 2 years old they're sleeping 11-14 hours.\n\nEven though they sleep more than adults, it's not the same *type* of sleep as adults. Adults spend about 20-25% of sleep, in [[sleep|REM sleep]], but newborns spend about half their sleep in REM.\n\n## Senses\nThe [[sense|senses]] of a newborn are remarkably developed, compared to the rest of the animal kingdom\u2014which sort of makes up for the fact that they are remarkably helpless, physically. All five senses function at birth, and even before birth, [[prenatal development|in utero]].\n\n### Hearing\n[[ears|Hearing]] is the earliest thing to develop. It's the sense that they use to hear outside of the womb, and they can recognize voices they heard in the womb, quickly recognizing the mother and anyone else who spoke to the fetus.\n\nHearing problems can be difficult to diagnose, because most babies can hear *some* sound. Not hearing, or not hearing well slows down [[language acquisition]]. Identifying a hearing problem before age 1 and giving the baby [[cochlear implants]] works to not delay language acquisition.\n\n### Seeing\n[[Vision]] is less mature than hearing at birth, which makes sense as there's not much to see in the womb. \n\n- **Newborns** can really on focus on what is right before their eyes (i.e. mom's face if [[breastfeeding]])\n- At **2 months**, infants can start to see faces, which we can tell because we can see them stare at faces and smile.\n- Between **2 to 4 months** *binocular vision* develops.\n- At **3 months** infants can respond differently do different facial expressions. I.e. they smile back at happy faces, and are neutral to neutral ones. They are more attracted to movement, and to eyes.\n- By **1 year**, infants can interpret facial expressions, follow another's gaze, and even use their own eyes to communicate.\n\n### Smell & Taste\n[[nose|Smell]] and [[tongue|taste]] are both functioning at birth, and these are highly influenced by the mother's diet during pregnancy. Baby swallows the amniotic fluid and gets the tastes from the mother's diet that way.\n\n## Touch & Nociception\nBabies of course feel touch and pain, but it appears that they feel pain *less acutely* than adults. \n\n## Emotions\nWhen babies are first born they are only capable of being upset or content. As they grow and their [[limbic system]] develops, they are able to feel more complex emotions. By 18 months (give or take) they are capable of the full range of emotions adults are capable of.\n\nage | developed emotion\n---|---\nbirth | distress, contentment\n6 weeks | social smile\n3 months | laughter, curiosity\n4 months | a real, responsive smile\n4-8 month | anger\n9-14 months | fear of social events (strangers, seperation)\n12 months | fear of unexpected sights/sounds\n18 months | self-awareness, pride, shame, embarrassment\n\nSelf-awareness, or an awareness of one's [[self-concept]] is one of the last things to develop. We consider this happening when a child can pass the Mirror Test. A child is shown a mirror. Then the tester makes a mark (or pretends to make a mark) on the child's face. If they look in the mirror to see the mark, then that shows they understand that the figure in the mirror is themselves.\n\n___\n\n", "tags": [], "links": ["myelination", "malnutrition", "sleep", "brain", "life-span development", "self-concept", "breastfeeding", "neurons", "language acquisition", "cerebrum", "transient exuberance and pruning", "synapse", "ears", "limbic system", "sense", "prenatal development", "motor skills", "tongue", "nose"]}, {"title": "muscle tissue", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [biology, a&p]\n---\n# Muscle Tissue\n---\n**Muscle tissue** is a [[tissue]] that allows us to move through a coordinated series of contracting then relaxing.\n\n## Types\nThe three types of muscles are *skeletal*, *cardiac* and *smooth muscle*\n\n- [[Skeletal muscle]] is the \"muscle\" muscle that moves around our bodies.

Broadly speaking there are four different types of health assessments one might do:\n\n- **Initial comprehensive assessment**: This is used when the healthcare provider first sees the patient, or of there is time for them to do the full thing. This type of assessment gathers information not just by observing the patient's body systems, but also their past health history, their family history, their lifestyle and their health practices.\n- **Ongoing** or **partial assessment**: This is used when the patient is already admitted or done on an \"as needed\" bases. This happens after the comprehensive baseline has been established, and is more brief and frequent.\n- **Focused** or **problem-oriented assessment**: This is used when there is a known problem, and is used to assess that particular system/body part. For example, when a patient comes in complaining of an ear pain, it would be appropriate to assess bowel function or heart health at that time.\n- **Emergency assessment**: Is, appropriately, used in emergent scenarios, as a life-saving measure.

Over 90% of human genes can have alternative splicings. \n\n![[alternative splicing.png]]\n\n## The Spliceosome\nA **spliceosome** is a large and complex that catalyzes RNA splicing.

They are involved in *every* aspect of [[metabolism]], the [[cell cycle]], and survival in general. \n\n[^1]: Usually...see \"rybozyemes\"\n\nOur cyoplasm and our nucleus are *filled* with enzymes, and about 1/4 of our [[gene|genes]] code for enzymes.\n\nA **rybozyme** is a type of enzyme that is made out of RNA instead of proteins.\n\n## Structure\nEnzymes tend to be globular proteins[^2] with a hydrophobic core, a hydrophilic exterior, and an accessable **catalytic**, or **active site**. The active site is the place on an enzyme that binds to a [[protein]] or some other substance during a reaction.\n\n[^2]: Again...usually. Again, see \"rybozymes\"\n\n[[cofactor#Coenzymes|Coenzymes]] are non-protein particles that help, or in some cases allow, the function of an enzyme. They may or may not be chemically bound to the enzyme for them to work.\n\nEnzymes are generally very very large compared to their substrates, which fit into little pockets. The fit between the enzyme and their substrate is critical and very precise. Some enzymes are made out of many subunits that fit together precisely. \n\n![[enzyme and substrate.png]]\n\n## Functions\n It's difficult to overstate their importance. **Enzymes do *all of the work* in biology**. They build up, [[digestive enzymes|break down]], and recycle.\n\nThey bind *very* specifically to a *particular* substrate. \n\nWhen they are ready to do work, they have one structure. Once they bind to a substrate, and they go through a confirmational change, which can be very subtle, but effective. It either creates or breaks the chemical bonds of the substrate. Then, it releases the substrate and goes back to it's ready state.\n\n### Lowering the Activation Energy\nEnzymes lower a reaction's activation energy, which means that all these reactions  would occur normally, but now can proceed *considerably* faster than uncatalyzed reactions.\n\n![[enzyme activation energy.png]]\n\n## Constitutive & Inducible Enzymes\n**Constitutive enzymes** are produced just as a matter of course, whereas **inducible enzymes** are only produced under conditions where it would be helpful. \n\n## Enzyme Regulation\nIf enzymes were allowed to function unchecked, everything would get used up too fast, and thus enzymes need to be [[enzyme regulation|regulated]].\n\n## Enzyme Names\nEnzymes are described by their function, with the exception of a few arbitrarily named enzymes that were amung the first.

The brain is a very delicate organ that can be damaged relatively easily.\n\nThere are four main types of TBIs, concussions, contusions, penetrating injury and anoxic brain injury\n\n## Concussion Causes/Brain Science\nThe brain floats unattached inside the skull that has ridges and shelf-like areas. The brain is a delicate organ, similar to the consistency of soft butter or slightly-set gelatin, and sudden movement with force can result in the brain sliding back and forth which can cause temporary and permanent cognitive damage. It's cushioned from everyday jolts and bumps by cerebrospinal fluid inside your skull.\n\n_Cognitive_ refers to conscious mental activities such as thinking, reasoning, understanding, learning, memory, language, coordination, and emotion.\n\nThe most vulnerable areas of the brain are the **frontal** and **temporal** sides (lobes) due to their anatomy and proximity to the skull.\n\n**Frontal**\nResponsible for executive functioning, planning, organizing, complex thinking, focus and concentration, emotional self-regulation.\n\n**Temporal**\nResponsible for auditory processing, short-term memory, mood regulation.\n\n## Concussion Grades\n### Grade1\nIn a grade 1 concussion, you can experience a [[headache]], difficulty focusing, memory loss, [[dizziness]], and nausea. You can usually return to normal activities within a few days following a grade 1 concussion after the symptoms have fully passed.\n\n### Grade2\nThe symptoms of this moderate type of concussion may be similar to a grade 1 concussion, but a grade 2 concussion typically involves a brief loss of consciousness. This can last for at least a minute but less than five minutes. Additional symptoms include brief amnesia, ringing in the ears, and irritability. A grade 2 concussion requires many days of rest before returning to normal activities.\n\n### Grade3\nA severe concussion is where you lose consciousness for more than five minutes. The symptoms can also last for weeks before they may begin to subside. You are at risk of permanent brain damage with a grade 3 concussion.\n\n## Symptoms\nThe signs and symptoms of a concussion can be subtle and may not show up immediately. Symptoms can last for days, weeks or even longer.\n\nPhysical signs and symptoms of a concussion may include:\n\n- [[headache]]\n- Ringing in the ears\n- [[nausea]]\n- [[emesis|vomiting]]\n- Fatigue or drowsiness\n- Blurry vision\n\nOther signs and symptoms of a concussion include:\n\n-   Confusion or feeling as if in a fog\n-   [[amnesia]] surrounding the traumatic event\n-   [[Dizziness]] or \"seeing stars\"\n\nA witness may observe these signs and symptoms in the concussed person:\n\n-   Temporary loss of consciousness (though this doesn't always occur)\n-   Slurred speech\n-   Delayed response to questions\n-   Dazed appearance\n-   Forgetfulness, such as repeatedly asking the same question\n\n## Related Problems\n\n[[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]]\n\n## Second Impact Syndrome\nRarely, experiencing a second concussion before signs and symptoms of a first concussion have resolved may result in rapid and usually fatal brain swelling.\n\nIt's important for athletes never to return to sports while they're still experiencing signs and symptoms of concussion.\n\nDoctors and scientists do not entirely understand the biochemical changes that produce concussion symptoms. The fact that the symptoms are usually temporary leads scientists to believe that the chemical changes make brain cells behave incorrectly without actually killing the cells.\n\nThe chemical changes are sometimes called a \u201cneurometabolic cascade.\u201d The process of this \u201ccascade\u201d is complicated, but scientists think the injury causes the brain\u2019s nerve cells (neurons) to enter a state in which they can\u2019t communicate effectively with other neurons, leading to the symptoms of a concussion.\n\nGiven time and rest, the neurons will usually emerge from this dysfunctional state and begin to work correctly again. However, when the neurons are in an abnormal state, they are especially vulnerable to stress. They may die or be permanently damaged if reinjured before they\u2019ve had a chance to recover. That\u2019s why a second head injury that\u2019s incurred soon after a concussion can be so serious.\n\n**[[Second impact syndrome]]** or **(SIS)** is a severe, often fatal condition that occurs when someone suffering from a concussion is subjected to a second brain injury. SIS results in brain swelling that can very quickly cause long-term brain damage or death. SIS\u2019s cause is not fully understood, but it\u2019s thought that brain cells have a limited ability to control blood flow into brain tissue during recovery from concussion, causing them to be vulnerable to bloodflow-related swelling.\n\nSIS can happen when an injury is suffered even weeks after the initial concussion, and even a minor impact to the head during the vulnerable period can result in SIS.\n\n## Diagnosis\n### Neurological examination\n\nAfter your doctor asks detailed questions about your injury, he or she may perform a neurological examination. This evaluation includes checking your:\n\n-   Vision\n-   Hearing\n-   Strength and sensation\n-   Balance\n-   Coordination\n-   [[Reflexes]]\n\n### Cognitive testing\n\nYour doctor may conduct several tests to evaluate your thinking (cognitive) skills during a neurological examination. Testing may evaluate several factors, including your:\n\n-   Memory\n-   Concentration\n-   Ability to recall information\n\n## Seizures\nSeizures can happen in 1 to 5 of every ten people who have had a TBI, depending on where the injury occurred in the brain. The seizure usually happens where there is a scar in the brain as a consequence of the injury.\n\nDuring a seizure there is a sudden abnormal electrical disturbance in the brain that results in one or more of the following symptoms:\n\n-   Strange movement of your head, body, arms, legs, or eyes, such as stiffening or shaking\n-   Unresponsiveness and staring\n-   Chewing, lip smacking, or fumbling movements\n-   Strange smell, sound, feeling, taste, or visual images\n-   Sudden tiredness or dizziness\n-   Not being able to speak or understand others\n\nSymptoms of a seizure happen suddenly, and you are unable to control them. Seizures usually last only a few seconds or minutes, but sometimes continue for 5 to 10 minutes. You may have a bladder or bowel accident or bite your tongue during a seizure. After the seizure, you may be drowsy, weak, confused or have a hard time talking to or understanding others. After a severe seizure, one that lasts longer than 2 minutes, it may be harder for you to stand, walk or take care of yourself for a few days or even longer.\n\n### Early post-traumatic seizures\n\nA seizure in the first week after a brain injury is called an early post-traumatic seizure. About 25% of people who have an early post-traumatic seizure will have another seizure months or years later.\n\n## More neurological tests\n### Motor\nYour neurological examination includes motor testing, which is an evaluation of your movements, strength, and muscle tone. Most aspects of your motor exam involve your active participation, and some parts of your motor examination are passive and don\u2019t involve your participation.\n\nYour healthcare provider will begin by looking at you to see if you have any involuntary movements that could signal neurological disease, like tics or tremors. Your practitioner will also look to see if you have any changes in the size or appearance of your muscles, such as atrophy (shrinking), or contractions (muscles appear to be frozen in place). \n\nYour healthcare provider will check your muscle tone by asking you to relax, and then moving your arms and legs gently. Some neurological conditions affect muscle tone.\n\nFor example, a recent stroke can cause diminished muscle tone, but after a few months, a stroke can cause some of your muscles to be spastic. And if you have Parkinson\u2019s disease, your muscles can be rigid and choppy when your practitioner moves them. \n\nAnd the last part of your motor examination is a measure of your strength. You need to cooperate for this part of the exam by exerting your full strength for each of the movements your healthcare provider asks you to do. Each muscle group, such as the biceps and triceps of your arms and the muscles of your feet, will be rated on a scale of zero to five. \n\n### Sensory\nThe sensory part of your neurological examination can help your healthcare providers identify certain conditions, and it is especially helpful in distinguishing the difference between spine disease and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThe sensory portion of a neurological examination should not hurt. If you have any wounds or if you have severe pain, your practitioner may skip certain parts of your sensory examination to avoid exacerbating your discomfort.\u00a0\n\nYou need to participate and communicate with your healthcare provider during the sensory portion of your neurological examination. Your practitioner may ask you to look away or close your eyes for some of your sensory testing so your ability to detect sensations without seeing them can be accurately assessed.\u00a0\n\nYou may need to move a little bit for this portion of your exam, just so your practitioner can reach the areas on your skin that need to be tested. You need to take off your shoes and socks for your sensory exam.\u00a0\n\nYour healthcare provider will check your sensation to sharp and light touch, temperature, position, and vibration in all four of your limbs and possibly on other areas of your body as well.\n\n-   Your light touch may be tested with a cotton head of a QTip on your arms, hands, legs, and feet.\u00a0\n-   You may have a semi sharp (but not painful) device used to assess your ability to detect sharp sensation.\u00a0\n-   Your temperature sensation will be tested with something moderately cold, like a medical tuning fork.\u00a0\n-   Your ability to sense vibration will be examined with a vibrating tuning fork.\u00a0\n-   Your proprioception (position sense) will be tested as your healthcare provider gently moves your fingers and toes to see how well you can detect changes in position\u2014usually without looking.\u00a0\n\nYou will be asked to indicate when and where you feel these different sensations, and sometimes you might be asked to compare the sensation on the right and left sides of your body. You might also experience a sudden change of sensation, for example, as the QTip or sharp device is moved up on your legs or arms.\n\n### Reflexes\nYour reflexes are involuntary automatic muscle movements that your body makes without any effort. You don\u2019t need to do anything for the reflex portion of your neurological exam. This part of the neurological exam is done for all levels of consciousness and ages, including babies.\n\nThere are several reflexes that your healthcare provider will check, including a corneal reflex of your eye and deep tendon reflexes throughout your body. Your corneal reflex, also described as a blink reflex, is a measure of whether you blink if an object is brought close to your eye.\u00a0\n\nYour deep tendon reflexes are generally tested with a reflex hammer as your practitioner taps on your tendon to cause your muscle to jerk. This test does not hurt at all. Common deep tendon reflexes include the patellar, biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, ankle, and jaw jerk reflexes.\n\n### Walking and Coordination\nYour healthcare provider will also check your coordination and your gait (walking). Your gait involves many components, including coordination, balance, vision, muscle strength, and sensation.\u00a0\n\nYour practitioner may have already watched you walk into the room. Besides walking as you normally do, your gait exam includes specific tasks, such as walking one foot in front of the other.\n\nAnd your healthcare provider may do a *Romberg test* by asking you to stand with your feet together and your eyes closed. If it is difficult for you to balance this way, it could mean that you have trouble with proprioception or with the balance center of your brain.\n\n#### Just Coordination\nIn addition to the effect that your coordination has on your gait, your coordination will also be tested separately. Your healthcare provider will ask you to do a few tasks that can identify coordination issues.\n\n-   Your rapid alternating movements test is when your practitioner asks you to put your hands in your lap and quickly flip your hands from palm up to palms down.\n-   You will also be asked to accurately and quickly touch your finger to your nose and then to the practitioner\u2019s hand.\n-   Another test of coordination is quickly pinching and separating your thumb and forefinger, possibly with both hands at the same time.\u00a0\n-   Your healthcare provider may also ask you to move your heel up and down the opposite shin, one at a time.\u00a0\n\nCoordination relies on many skills, and a defect in coordination can help identify the cause of a neurological disease.\n\n### Language\nYour language examination has some features that overlap with your cognitive exam, but there are specific aspects of language that your healthcare provider will be testing. If there is a language barrier because you don\u2019t speak the same language as your practitioner, you may need a translator.\n\nYour language includes fluency and comprehension.\n\nFluency is your ability to speak with a normal rhythm.\nComprehension is your ability to understand the meaning of words and phrases, as well as your ability to use words correctly.\nA problem with language is described as aphasia. There are several types of aphasia. For example. fluent speech with impaired comprehension is described as Wernicke\u2019s aphasia. A deficit in language fluency is described as Broca\u2019s aphasia.\n\nThese language deficits, which are the most commonly identified, are often associated with strokes. A stroke is a type of brain damage caused by an interruption of blood flow. Blood vessels in the brain are arranged to supply blood to specific language regions that are dedicated to either fluency or comprehension.\n\nOther specific language deficits include conduction aphasia, stuttering, and anomic aphasia. Each of these is characterized by a specific speech pattern and can develop due to a stroke, a brain tumor, head trauma, or without a known reason. \n\n## Treatment\nAn important part of treatment for a concussion is getting plenty of rest, both sleep at night and naps or rest breaks during the day if needed. Your doctor will probably tell you to avoid certain physical activities and sports while you recover and may suggest medicine to take if you have a headache.\n\nIf your symptoms don't go away in a few days or if they get worse, you may need to see a doctor who specializes in concussions.\n\n\nThere is currently no treatment that will reverse the biochemical effects of a concussion in the brain. In most cases, the effects resolve on their own, given enough time and protection from further damage. Because of that, the treatment prescribed for concussion is almost always rest and protection from further injury. A doctor will usually suggest that the patient stay away from activities, such as physical or mental exertion, that could make symptoms worse.\n\nThe treatment can also include shortened work or school days, breaks from assignments and mentally complex tasks, and avoidance of technology utilizing display screens, such as TV, computers, and phones.\n\nTo treat headaches, a doctor will usually suggest over-the-counter pain relievers containing acetaminophen because concussion-related headaches often don\u2019t respond well to more potent prescription painkillers. Pain relievers containing ibuprofen or aspirin may increase the risk of bleeding and are generally not recommended in the case of head injuries.\n\n**athletes**\nNever return to play or vigorous activity while signs or symptoms of a concussion are present.\n\nExperts recommend that an athlete with a suspected concussion not return to activities that are associated with a higher risk of another concussion while still showing concussion symptoms.\n\nChildren and adolescents should be evaluated by a health care professional trained in evaluating and managing pediatric concussions.\n\nExperts also recommend that adult, child and adolescent athletes with concussions not return to play on the same day as the injury.\n\n\n\n\n%%page end here%%\n___", "tags": [], "links": ["brain", "dizziness", "emesis", "nausea", "headache", "chronic traumatic encephalopathy", "injury"]}, {"title": "passive transport", "text": "---\naliases: [simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, diffusion, diffuse]\ntags: [biology, cell, a&p]\n---\n# Passive Transport\n---\n**Passive transport** is types of [[membrane transport]] that do not require expenditure of [[ATP]] to operate, instead using phenomenon like the [[energy|kinetic energy]] of molecules and the tendency of solutes to even out a [[concentration gradient]] toward [[equilibrium]].\n\n## Simple Diffusion\n**Simple diffusion** is the process of molecules moving directly from one side of a [[plasma membrane]] to the other, towards [[equilibrium]]. It is important to note that diffusion is defined by a *difference in [[concentration gradient|concentration]] over time*. Random motion of molecules at equilibrium doesn't count. \n\nGenerally speaking only small, [[polar and nonpolar|nonpolar]] molecules can pass through membranes through simple diffusion. It doesn't have to be all three: for example, water can diffuse though even though it is polar because it is so small. Still, most of the water that passes though the membrane does so through membrane channels called **aquaporins**.\n\n## Facilitated Diffusion\n**Facilitated diffusion** is similar to simple diffusion in that it allows solutes pass across the membrane with the [[concentration gradient]], *without* costing energy. However, if the cell wants to transport larger or more [[polar and nonpolar|polar]] solutes at a faster rate than they can pass through the [[plasma membrane]], then it has special [[membrane transport protein|membrane transport proteins]] that facilitate the diffusion. There are two main types, of transport proteins used in facilitated diffusion: \n- [[channel proteins]] transport small ions \n- [[carrier proteins]] transport large polar molecules.\n\nFacilitated diffusion typically occurs in one direction for any given solute. Various factors effect the rate of facilitated diffusion, such as the concentration of solutes, the number of transport proteins in the membrane, the steepness of the concentration gradient, and the presence/concentration or absence of neurotransmitters or a specific electrical charge that activates a gated channel.\n\n## Osmosis\n[[Osmosis]] is the phenomenon where water moves across a semi-permeable membrane to even out a concentration gradient. Water *can* pass through biological membrane, but will only *diffuse* across one under duress. In other words, it *can* but it doesn't *like to*. \n\n## Filtration\n**Filtration** is the passage through a membrane through small holes, like the [[glomerular filtration]] that takes place in the kidneys.

The DNA that is incorperated into the host genome is called a \"prophage\" and the cell itself is catagorized as a \"lysogen\". Now, every time the lysogen replicates, it replicates the prophage DNA along with it's regular DNA.\n\nThis can continue along the generations until certain conditions are met that trigger a [[phage switch]], which is the conversion from lysogenic infection to [[productive infection]].\n\n![[lysogenic cycle.png]]\n\n## Consequences of Lysogeny\n### Prophages Offer Protection from Other Phage Infection\nOnce a prophage has inegrated into it's host's DNA, it has a vested interest in keeping that cell alive, and not ceeding that ground to a different phage. So, since the prophage already is using a repressor protein to keep itself integrated into the lysogen's DNA, it can use that same repressor to bind to any other phage's DNA and prevents it from replicating, effectivly rendering it null. \n\n### Lysogenic Conversion\n**Lysogenic conversion** is when a lysogen gains a new ability as a direct result of having a prophage in it's DNA. For example, *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* is the bacteria which causes diptheria in humans because it can produce a particular type of toxin. However, not just any *Corynebacterium diphteriae* cell can make the toxin. It's only the ones that are infected with a particular bacteriophage that can produces it.\n___\n\n", "tags": ["Steps"], "links": ["productive infection", "phage switch", "bacteriophage"]}, {"title": "Gram stain", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [biology, microbiology, lab]\n---\n# Gram Staining\n---\n**Gram staining** is a differential test that can be done in a [[lab]] to determine if a sertain [[bacteria]] is Gram [[Gram positive bacteria|positive]] or [[Gram negative bacteria|negative]]\n\n![[Gram negative and positive diagram.png]]\n![[Gram negative and positive stain.png]]\n## Procedure\n\n![[Gram stains.png]]\n___\n", "tags": [], "links": ["bacteria", "Gram positive bacteria", "Gram negative bacteria", "lab"]}, {"title": "sleep deprivation", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: []\nqueue: 5\nnotes: 'just get a little bit set up'\ndone: 5\n---\n# sleep deprivation\n---\n**sleep deprivation**\n\n[[sleep]]\n\nDecreased amount, consistency or quality of sleep\no Symptoms seen in those awake for 30 continual hours or more (but can also be with like, new parents)\n\tLoss of concentration/brainfog\n\tSlowed reflexes\n\tIncreased anxiety\n\tMoody\n\tChronic deprivation may lead to *decreased* healing, depression, associated with other major illnesses including depression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___", "tags": [], "links": ["sleep"]}, {"title": "calvin cycle", "text": "---\naliases: [rubisco, light independent reaction]\ntags: [biology, metabolism]\n---\n# The Calvin Cycle\n---\nThe **Calvin cycle** is a process that happens in plants during [[photosynthesis]] that fixes CO$_2$ into a usable form.

About 99% of our body's calcium is in the [[bone#Structure|hydroxyapatites]] of the bones.\n\nThe rest of the 1% of our calcium lives in the blood and soft tissues. There it helps [[nerves]] action by stimulating the release of [[neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]], and helps [[muscle tissue|muscle]] function by allowing muscles to contract. In fact, not enough calcium results in **calcium tetany**, or twitching and spasms due to lack of calcium, and too much calcium results in **calcium rigor**, or an inability of the muscles (including heart muscles!) to relax. Fortunately, as calcium levels are tightly [[#Calcium Regulation|regulated]], instances of those issues are rare.\n\n## Calcium Regulation\nCalcium is [[acids and bases|alkaline]], and thus maintaining the levels in the bloodstream are vitally important. \n\nIn order to *raise* calcium levels if they are too low, the [[thyroid|parathyroid]] glands release a hormone called [[parathyroid hormone]] (or **PTH** or **parathormone**). PHT signals for the [[kidneys]] to increase reabsorption of calcium (keeping it instead of expelling it) and it stimulates the activation of [[vitamin D]]. Both vitamin D and PHT stimulate the [[bone remodeling|breaking down]] of the bone to release calcium into the blood, and the vitamin D increases the rate of absorption of calcium from the intestines.\n\nIn order to *lower* calcium levels, PHT is inhibited, which reduces [[vitamin D]] activation, inhibits [[bone cells|osteoclasts]], and signals for the [[kidneys]] to expel calcium.\n\n### Hyper- & Hypocalcemia\n**Hypercalcemia** is a condition where there is too high a level of calcium in the blood. Our normal calcium regulation system is generally good enough to prevent this, but various diseases and metabolic disorders can lead to it. Symptoms of hypercalcemia include fatigue, loss of appetite, constipation, confusion and even coma or death. \n\n**Hypocalcemia** is a condition where there isn't enough calcium in the blood. As we have a very efficient reservoir of calcium in our bones, this is not usually due to a lack of dietary calcium. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include muscles spasms and convulsions.\n\n## Hormones that Effect Blood Calcium Levels\n- [[parathyroid hormone]] plays a critical role in not only triggering the absorption of calcium from the intestines, but also activating [[bone cells|osteoclasts]], and triggering the [[kidneys]] to retain calcium from the blood.\n\n- [[thyroid|calcitonin]] this is not well understood but it is definitely important somehow.\n\n___", "tags": ["Calcium", "Structure"], "links": ["parathyroid hormone", "acids and bases", "vitamin D", "thyroid", "kidneys", "muscle tissue", "bone cells", "bone", "neurotransmitter", "bone remodeling", "teeth", "nerves", "mineral"]}, {"title": "urination", "text": "---\naliases: [micturition, voiding]\ntags: [urinary]\n---\n# Urination\n---\n**Urination** or **micturition** is the act of emptying the [[bladder]] of urine.

The inability to retain urine unless desired is called [[urinary incontinence]] and can happen for a variety of reasons, including the side effect of medicines, or damage to the nerves that connect to the bladder.\n\n## Physiology of Urination\nThere are two reflexes that govern urination, the **storage reflex** and the **micturition reflex**. When the bladder gets full, it sends signals to the [[pons]].\n\nThe muscles of the bladder, including the internal sphincter are [[nerves|innervated]] by both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system.

In other words, it's our view of who we are. It's multidimensional, and it's drawn from almost every aspect of one's life. Heritage, gender roles, ethics, spirituality, upbringing (like if they've experienced [[trauma informed care|ACEs]], personality traits...essentially one's cumulative life experience. It helps people make sense of their past and present. It's important to understand this concept in [[nursing]] because a patient's self-concept will say a lot about their reactions to being sick. One's [[body image]] is closely linked with self-concept, and any change in physical appearance or function can challenge it.\n\nAlthough it is very internal to a person, the development of self-concept is largely due to external factors, such as upbringing and socialization. Babies do not have a self concept, and it starts to develop when a small child can recognize themselves in a mirror. It's often influenced or reinforced by social interactions, even by very subtle cues from the other person. \n\n## Self-Concept Clarity\n**Self-concept clarity** is the extent to which one's self concept is clearly and confidently defined, internally consistent and temporally stable. A well-integrated self-concept is *consistency*. When you're not consistent or coherent, that's we're falling apart. It's not always easy to maintain consistency in a violently changing world, or after a drastic health diagnosis. A strong sense of self-concept is a **protective factor** in coping, as it can be drawn on as a source of strength. \n\nSelf-concept clarity being temporally stable does *not* mean that it does not change. Self-concept does grown and change over time.\n\nSelf-concept clarity is positively related to enactment of meaningful identity choices, whereas it is negatively related to identity crises driven by reconsidering and discarding current commitments. Thus, self-concept clarity is intertwined with healthy identity development.\n\n## Self-Esteem\n**Self-esteem** is the *emotional value* that a person places on their self-concept. It's one's overall sense of worth and well-being. According to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], a high self-esteem is necessary before reaching the top piece of self-actualization\u2014although, interestingly Maslow considered the esteem of others more important than the internal, self-esteem\n\nWhat are some factors that affect self-esteem?\n- Age\n- Disability\n- Illness\n- Physical abilities\n- Socioeconomic status\n- Thought patterns\n- Racism and discrimination have also been shown to have negative effects on self-esteem\n- Genetic factors that help shape a person's personality can play a role, but life experiences are thought to be the most important factor.\n\nIllness and injury can have a damaging effect on one's self-esteem.

It begins with the closing of the [[heart#Valves|semilunar valves]] (i.e. [[heart sounds|S2]]). At the beginning of diastole the [[heart#Valves|AV valves]] are open and blood flows from the veins (vena cava and pulmonary veins) to the atria to the ventricles.

The limit of resolution of the compound light microscope is approximately 0.2 $\\mu m$, which is limited by the wavelength of visible light.\n\n>[!people] Robert Hooke\n>Englishman **Robert Hooke** invented the first light microscope that had **30x magnification**. This was revolutionary, as it allowed us to see individual cells\u2014a feat that allowed the rise of [[cell|cell theory]]. \n\n\n## Compound Microscope\n**Compound microscopes** have at least two magnifying lenses. Most often they are and ocular lens and an objective lens. They can magnify a specimen anywhere from 40 times its original size to 1000 times its original size.\n\n![[compound microscope.png]]\n\n### Lenses\n**Ocular lenses** are located within the eyepieces. Typical magnification is 10x. If it's a binocular microscope, there are two lenses that can be brought closer together or further apart \n\n**Objective lenses** are located on a revolving nose piece that extends outward over the stage. There are 3-4 objective lenses, each with a different magnification and working distance. The magnification is written on the lens itself.\n\nThe **scanning lens** is the shortest objective lens. It typically has a magnification of 4x.\n\nThe **low power lens** is the second shortest objective lens. It typically has a magnification of 10x.\n\nThe **high power lens** is the objective lens that is longer/stronger than the low power lens. It typically has a magnification of 40x, 44x or 45x.\n\nThe longest objective lens is the **oil immersion lens**, called because it needs oil between the lens and the specimen to work properly. It typically has a magnification of 100x.\n\nTo get the best results, the drop of oil must be big enough so that the 100x lens actually touches the oil.\n\n## Determining Magnification on a Compound Microscope\nThe total magnification of a compound microscope is the magnification of the ocular lens *times* the magnification of the objective lens. \n\n## The Illumination System\nThe **light source** is a light bulb in a housing at the base of the microscope.\n\nThe **rheostat** is a rotating knob used to adjust the amount of light passing out of the light source.\n\nSome microscopes have a **filter** that lies on top of the light source, in order to filter out certain light wavelengths to improve resolution. \n\nThe **condenser lens** lies between the stage and the light source. It focuses the light by refraction. Sometimes the hight can be adjusted with it's own knob. \n\nThe **iris diaphragm** allow the user to easily adjust the amount of light passing upward through the condenser lens, and can be adjusted with a flattened lever that protrudes from just below the condenser. \n\nThe **stage** is the flat surface on which the specimen is placed. A **mechanical stage** as a spring lever that holds the slide in place. \n\nThe **stage transnational control knobs** are located on one side of the stage, just below the surface. They control the side-to-side and forward-to-back positioning of the stage.\n\n![[microscope stage.png]]\n\n### Focusing\nLenses are focused by using the coarse and fine \"focus adjustment knobs\" to move the stage or nosepiece up or down. These knobs are located at the sides of the base. \n\nThe **coarse focus adjustment knobs** are only to be used with the [[light microscope#^scanning|scanning objective lens]] in place, and at its highest position. \n\nOnce the coarse focus has been completed, one can move onto the other objective lenses. Once there only the **fine focus adjustment knob** should be used. \n\n## Dissecting Microscope\n**Dissecting microscopes** (or \"stereoscopic microscopes\") have a relatively low magnification, and are used to view and manipulate objects athat are too large to view under a compound microscope. It has a relativly low [[microscope#^magnification|magnification]], rarely above 30x. Like a compound microscopes, dissecting microscopes use objective lenses, and sometimes also use ocular lenses.

A wall of myocardium called the **interventricular septum** separates the two left chambers from the two right chambers. Each side side has one **atrium** (plural: **atria**) and one **ventricle**.\n\nThe **atria** are the two superior chambers. They fill up with blood returning to the heart from the [[veins]]. They [[cardiac cycle|pump]] (in unison) blood into the inferior **ventricles** through the **atrioventricular valves**.

The AV valves close when the ventricles [[cardiac cycle|contract]] and the increased pressure pushes them closed. They are prevented from going all the way into the atria by tendons called **chordae tendineae** (colloquially knowns as *heart strings*) which are attached to **papillary muscles** at the base of the ventricles.\n\nThe **semilunar valves** separate the ventricles from the main [[arteries]].

In [[nursing]] the metaparadigms are **person**, **environment**, **health**, and **nursing** itself.\n\n## Person\nThe **person** metaparadigm of nursing refers not only to the patient, but their family and friends as well. In nursing we want to have the person the center of what we do, often referred to as \"person-centered care\". *A person is more than the sum of their medical history*. It's the difference between seeing some illness or injury to treat first and the person affected by those things second, or seeing the person first and their illness or injury second. We always strive to empower patients to have as much say, control and power as they can in regards to their own health and wellbeing. This is why health education is so imporant, and why we always want the patient to do as much of their own care as they can.\n\n## Environment\nThe **environment** metaparadigm of nursing refers to the components that go into the patient's surroundings. This does include the patient's physical surroundings like in their room, but also their emotional and social surroundings, and broader environments like their economic conditions, geographic locations, [[culture]] and technology as well. Essentially anything that can have an impact on one's health or wellbeing is part of their environment.\n\n## Health\nThe **health** metaparadigm of nursing refers to where a patient falls on the health-illness continuum during their encounter. This includes physical health, but also [[mental health|mental]], emotional, social and [[spirituality]] health. Any given person's health is expected to fluxuate over the course of their life\u2014sometimes we're sick and sometimes we're healthy! The health-illness continuum also takes into account how someone's health status will change, and how a past or current illness can affect them for the rest if their lives. It's also individualized\u2014what is healthy for an 80 year old man may not be for a 18 year old.\n\n## Nursing\nThe **nursing** metaparadigm refers to the body of knowledge\u2014including theory, practice, and skills, as well as caring and compassion\u2014that make up the skillset that is nursing.

They use **beams of [[atom#Electrons Electron Shells|electrons]] or [[radiation]]** to magnify the subject. \n\n## Terms\n**Working distance** is the distance between the specimen and the objective lens. The microscopist does not want to touch the specimen with her/his lens and risk damage to the lens.\n\n**Depth of field** refers to the distance between the closest and farthest objects that are in focus. \n\nA **parfocal lens** is a lens that stays in focus then the magnification/focal length is changed. Or when one objective lens is in focus, then the other objectives will also be in focus.\n\n## Resolution\n**Resolution** describes the ability to distinguish two points, a certain distance apart, as separate points. The better the resolution, the \"sharper\" the image appears.\n\nThe **limit of resolution** (or resolving power) is a measure of the ability of a lens to separate in the image adjacent details that are present in the object. In other words, it is the distance between two points in the object that are just resolved in the image. \n\nFor example: The limit of resolution of your eye is approximately 0.1 mm. What does this mean? Your eyes can distinguish two objects that are 0.1 mm apart as two separate objects. If two points are only 0.05 mm apart, your eye would \"see\" them as a single point. This distance would be beyond the limit of resolution of your eyes.\n\nWhen describing resolution, use of the terms \"greater\" or \"smaller\" may be misleading. The smaller the limit of resolution, the better the resolution.\n\nTwo main things determine the limit of resolution:\n-  The **wavelength of light** passing through the specimen. The shorter the wavelength, the better the resolution. The light microscope's resolution is limited by the wavelengths of visible light.  \n- Numerical **aperture** of the lens.

Different types of foods create weaker or stronger level of satiety, depending on what they are made up of. High-fat foods have a higher satiety value than high-carb foods, and the more fiber or water a food has the more it stretches the [[stomach]] and [[small intestine]], and so sends stronger satiety signals.

Ghrelin levels slowly increase after the last time you ate, and high levels of it trigger the [[hypothalamus|feeding center]] of the hypothalamus. The opposing hormone to ghrelin is cholecystokinin, which is produced when food enters the [[small intestine]], and the presence of that triggers the [[hypothalamus#Hunger|satiety center]] of the hypothalamus.\n\n**[[Leptin]]** is a hormone that regulates huger in the long term.

This can be understood as being on two continuums, one of **avoidance** and one of **anxiety**, as visualized below:\n\n![[attachment continuums.png]]\n\n## Secure Attachment\n**Secure attachment** is (fortunatly) the most common, and is indicated by a child that is able to seperate from their caregiver, but who prefers them to strangers. These children are comfortable and confident, and can use their caregivers as a \"base\" of exploration, which allows them to explore their envornment freely when their caregiver is there. If the caregiver leaves the child is upset, and when the caregiver comes back the child is happy. Later in life securely attached children have supportive relationships and a positive self-concept.\n\n**Attachment behaviors** are behaviors that indicate an infant has developed a secure attachment.\n\n**Synchrony** is a phenomenon that babies and caregivers naturally do all over the world. It begins at about 3 months and involves a smooth, coordinated exchange of animated expressions and actions that happen with remarkable coordination. Developing synchrony is essential to the development of babies. By 6 months infants are clearly upset if their caregivers are unresponsive, including crying, flailing and vocalizing.\n\n**Separation anxiety** is normal by age 1, and generally intensifies until age 2 when it starts to subside. **Stranger wariness** is also normal at this time. If these behaviors persist after 3 years, to the point where it is disruptive to their lives, they become [[psychological disorders|emotional disorders]].\n\n**Social referencing** is something that we all do, but is first evident when toddlers start walking, and look for help for how to navigate new situations by looking towards their adult. An example is watching how adults eat new foods to see how they react, and then mimic that.\n\n## Insecure Attachment\n**Insecure attachment** is divided up into two types: **avoidant** and **resistant/ambivalent** attachment. **Insecure-avoidant attachment** is when an infant really avoids their caregiver, and doesn't react or seem to care when the caregiver leaves or comes back. These individuals tend to be loners or aloof in their personal relationships as adults. **Insecure-resistant/ambivalent attachment** is characterized by an infant that becomes *very* upset when a caregiver leaves, and both resists and seeks contact when they come back. In adulthood they have angry, stormy or unpredictable relationships, and have few long-term friends.\n\n>[!abstract] Abuse or neglect\n>**Childhood abuse** is a predictor for resistant/ambivilant or disorganized attachement, while **childhood neglect** is a predictor for avoidant attachment.\n\n## Disorganized Attachment\n**Disorganized attachment** is (fortunately) the least common type, and the most concerning. It's characterized by inconsistent reactions when a caregiver leaves or returns. This type of adult demonstrates odd and erratic behavior, and it's a risk factor for serious [[psychological disorders]]. \n\nResearchers refer to avoidant attachment as **type A**, secure attachment as **type B**, resistant/ambivalent attachment as **type C** and disorganized attachment as **type D**\n\n## The Strange Situation\nThe **Strange Situation** is a standardized lab procedure that can be used to observe the interactions of the parents and their children. It is set up in a well-equipped playroom and has the parent or other, unknown adult perform a set-series of actions, such as entering and and leaving the room. Researchers are trained to look for specific behaviors in the child.\n\n## Children Without and Attachment Figure\nSeeking comfort for distress is a learned behavior. Children who are neglected can end up not attaching to anyone, and do not realize that an adult can make them feel better.

People with high fluid intelligence can easily draw inferences, grasp relationships between concepts and have a large [[memory|working memory]]. \n\n**Crystallized intelligence** is the accumulation of facts, information and knowledge that comes from direct education or experience\u2014or \"book smarts\". People with high crystallized intelligence have a large vocabulary, know lots of facts or dates in history.\n\n>[!people] Cattell & Horn\n> The \"two clusters of intelligence\" (i.e. fluid and crystallized) framework for understaning intelligence was first understood by researchers **Raymond Cattell** and **John Horn**\n\n### Analytic, Creative & Practical Intelligence\nOne way of classifying intelligence is in three fundamental buckets of intelligence: **analytic**, **creative**, and **practical** intelligence.  \n\n**Analytic intelligence** is used for abstract planning, strategizing, focused attention, and logic. It's useful for analyzing data, learning and understanding, remembering and thinking.\n\n**Creative intelligence** is used for creativity, imagination, and expecting the unexpected. It's useful for intellectual flexibility and originality.\n\n**Practical intelligence** is used for understanding and assessing daily problems, applying skills and knowledge, and being adaptive. It's useful for it's adaptability, cooperation and family interactions.\n\n>[!people] Robert Sternberg\n**Roberst Sternberg** first proposed the \"three forms of intelligence\" (analytic, creative, practical).\n\n___", "tags": [], "links": ["memory", "psychology"]}, {"title": "membrane potential", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [biology, chemistry, nervous]\n---\n# Membrane Potential\n---\nA cell's **membrane potential** is the *relative* [[electricity|voltage]] [[concentration gradient|gradient]] across that cell's [[plasma membrane]].

It is not a singular process, but rather a combination of several interrelated processes. It may go without saying, but each different [[nutrients|macronutrient]]: ([[carbohydrates|carbs]], [[lipid|lipids]] and [[protein|proteins]]) need to be broken down by their own specific [[enzyme]]. Each of these of enzyme is produced in one or more distinct segments of the [[digestive system|gastrointestinal tract]].\n\nThe [[carbohydrate digestion]] happens largely in the [[mouth]] and [[small intestine]] by digestive enzymes digestive enzymes called *amylases*. \n\nThe [[protein digestion]] happens largely in the [[stomach]] and [[small intestine]] by digestive enzymes called *proteases*.\n\n[[Lipid digestion]] is mostly done in the [[small intestine]]. It is complicated by the fact that lipids are [[polar and nonpolar|hydrophobic]], and thus cannot be deposited directly into the bloodstream. First they must be emulsified by the action of the [[polar and nonpolar|amphipathic]] bile salts found in [[liver|bile]], which create lipoprotein called [[lipoprotein|chylomicrons]]. These exit the [[enterocytes]] into the [[lymphatic system|lymph]] where they then enter the [[blood]] where they eventually reach the [[liver]] and from there are processed.\n\n![[digestive enzymes.png]]\n\n## Mechanical and Chemical Digestion\n**Mechanical digestion** is the physical breaking down of food particles into smaller pieces. It occurs in the [[mouth]] by chewing and [[stomach]] by the contraction of its muscles.\n\n**Chemical digestion** is the breaking down of food by using [[digestive enzymes]] produced in the [[salivary glands]] the [[stomach]], the [[pancreas]], and the [[liver]].\n\n## Propulsion & Mixing\nThe contents of the GI tract must be moved along from start to end, and they also need to be thoroughly mixed up, so we can gain all the nutrients we can from it. There are two main ways the digestive system physically acts on it's contents to move it around. \n\nThe material being digested is mixed up by a process called **segmentation**, where the stuff is squeezed so that some of it moves forward, and some of it moves back. This action is repeated multiple times so that the material is churned up and mixed together.\n\nThe material being digested is moved forward by a process called [[peristalsis]], which uses the rhythmic contraction of smooth muscle to squeeze the contents forward like toothpaste from a tube. \n\n![[GI motility.png]]\n\n## Stages of Digestion\nThere are three stages of digestion that are initiated and concluded depending on where the food material is in the [[gastrointestinal tract|GI tract]].\n\nThe **cephalic phase** begins with the **cephalic reflex**, which is triggered by the sight, thought, smell of food, or even the sound of food being prepared. The [[medulla oblongata]] relays signals along the [[vagus nerve]] to the [[stomach]] which triggers it to increase the force of its contractions, and to begin releasing its gastric secretions.\n\nThe **gastric phase** begins when food enters the stomach. Mechanoreceptors detect the stretch of material entering the stomach, and chemoreceptors detect [[protein]] or high [[pH]]. The signals are relayed to the [[medulla oblongata]] which relays back down the [[vagus nerve]] to continue to increase both the force of the stomach contractions and produce secretions. The [[gastric gland|G-cells]] to secrete [[gastric gland|gastrin]], which also has those effects, as well as causing contraction of the [[stomach|pyloric sphincter]]. \n\nThe **intestinal phase** begins when acidic [[stomach|chyme]] enters the [[duodenum]], and typically stays in the [[small intestine]] for about 12 hours. Chemoreceptors on the intestinal wall detect the low [[pH]] and send those signals to the [[medulla oblongata]], which then *decreases* its signals along the [[vagus nerve]] and this reduces the force of the stomach's contractions and secretions. Acidic chyme also has the effect of releasing [[duodenum|secretin]] which inhibits the stomach's secretions; fatty chime causes the release of [[cholecystokinin]], which decreases the force of contractions in the stomach.\n\n\n___", "tags": [], "links": ["gastric gland", "carbohydrates", "liver", "nutrients", "lymphatic system", "protein digestion", "blood", "enterocytes", "medulla oblongata", "pH", "lipid", "stomach", "peristalsis", "salivary glands", "gastrointestinal tract", "digestive system", "vagus nerve", "enzyme", "lipoprotein", "carbohydrate digestion", "small intestine", "polar and nonpolar", "digestive enzymes", "pancreas", "cholecystokinin", "protein", "mouth", "duodenum"]}, {"title": "lipid", "text": "---\naliases: [wax]\ntags: [biology, chemistry, nutrition]\n---\n# Lipids\n---\n**Lipids** are one of the four main classes of [[macromolecules]].

Before the development of cognitive theory, the common understanding of psychology undervalued how and what people thought about affected their actions. For example, not one really realized that babies could think! Now we understand that at every age\u2014even [[infant|newborns]]\u2014have tons of thoughts, and these fundamentally affect our behavior and actions.\n\n>[!help] Cognition vs Thinking\n>In general \"cognition\" and \"thinking\" are used pretty interchangeably. This note is about *cognitive theory* as first explored by Jean Piaget. For notes on \"cognition\" itself (i.e. \"thinking\") [[intelligence]].\n\nThere are four stages of [[life-span development|development]] that we progress through...although there aren't any hard lines or times where these emerge. Additionally some people can be in one stage for one type of situation, and another for another.\n\n>[!people] Jean Piaget\n>**Jean Piaget** developed cognative theory in part by really listening to children\u2014especially when they were explaining things incorrectly. Contrary to popular understanding at the time, he discovered that infants were capable of thought and curiosity, and how children think changes over time. For his foundational and revolutionary development of his cognative theory he's called the greatest developmental pychologist *of all time*.\n\n## Sensorimotor Intelligence (Ages 0-2)\nThe **sensorimotor** period is the period in which individuals use **senses** and **motor abilities** to understand the world; learning is *active*, without reflection. Infants at this age act out a continuous series of feedback loops between their actions and perceptions called **circular reactions** which become increasingly complex as they get older.\n\n**Primary circular reactions** (birth to 4 months) involve just the infant's own body. They kick or thrash, suck on their hand or anything that touches their lips, make noise. Eventually they learn to adapt their reactions, for example, if they are bottle-fed they will begin to suck more readily to a bottle, or vice versa for [[breastfeeding]].\n\n**Secondary circular reactions** (4-12 months) involve people and objects\u2014anything that they can grab. The beginning of this stage is characterized by their drive to **make interesting thing last**. If a rattle they're clutching makes a noise when they flail their arm, then they keep flailing their arm. Around 8 months they begin to be more deliberate with their reactions, and even take their own actions to elicit the desired outcome. Babies point or fuss to get what they want, or even bring objects to people, and make their desires known, like if a baby grabs their adult's hands and motions to play patty-cake. It is during this stage that babies being to show they are obtaining [[object permanence]], though brain scans show that babies *understand* some object permanence before they're able to react accordingly.\n\n**Tertiary circular reactions** (12-24 months) is the final type of circular reactions, which involve moving though the world and actively experimenting with their surroundings. At this stage they are **little scientists**, unrolling all the toilet paper, squeezing out all the toothpaste, trying to flush their toy doing the toilet. Around 18 months toddlers are able to use their experiments to be a little more intentional with their actions, and can start to think though the consequences. We also see toddlers mimic behavior that they have seen previously, called **deferred imitation**.\n\n## Preoperational (Ages 2-6)\nThe **preoperational** period is the period in which individuals are now able think symbolically (i.e. with language), yet perceive everything **egocentrically**, and make many logical fallacies due to a lack of experience and an underdeveloped brain. For example, a child at this stage knows what a dog is, but is unable to really explain why. \"A dog is a dog, because that's what a dog is\". \n\nThere are four major hurdles to logic that preoperational children fall to: centration, focus on appearance, static reasoning and irreversibility.\n\n**Centration** is the tendency to focus on one aspect of a thing, to the exclusion of all others. For example, it's hard for children to comprehend that their mother is also their grandmother's daughter. A common form this takes is **egocentrism** which is a tendency for children to think exclusively from their own point of view. This is somewhat related to the [[theory of mind]] which does develop a this stage, but it's a distinct concepts.\n\n**Focus on appearance** is similar to centration in that children focus entirely on how something looks and disregard anything else. For example, a girl might thin she has turned into a boy if her hair is cut short.\n\n**Static reasoning** is the belief that the world is static\u2014unchanging in the past and in the future. Like the surprise of learning that your teacher has a family and children of their own. If they understand things will change, they don't understand it's a gradual process sometimes, they think they'll just wake up one day and be tall.\n\n**Irreversibility** is the belief that no action can be undone, no matter how superficial. For example, a child might cry because someone put lettuce on their sandwich, and no amount of assurance will convince them that they can just take the lettuce off and they'll have a lettuce-free sandwich. The sandwich is forever made with lettuce. \n\n## Concrete Operational (Ages 6-11)\nThe **concrete operational** phase is the phase where individuals understand and apply **logic**, but thinking is limited to *direct experience*. This means that although they have overcome the barriers to logic of the preoperational stage, hypothetical or abstract concepts are beyond them.\n\n## Formal Operational (Ages 12~)\nThe **formal operational** phase is the a phase where individuals (adolescents) can not only apply logic but also consider hypothetical or abstract concepts, such as [[ethics]], politics, social justice, [[morality]], etc.\n\n## Postformal Thought (18?+)\n**Postformal thought** is the stage above the formal operational thought, which while specifically named by Piaget, has been found to be more complex and nuanced than the thinking of an adolescent. Postformal thought integrates emotions and pragmatic aspects, allowing for wisdom. \n\nA physiological change that characterizes postformal thought is a fully developed [[cerebrum|prefrontal cortex]], longer tracts connecting areas of the brain, and a multitude of areas of the brain that light up during a single event.\n\nNot every adult reaches postformal thought.\n\n\n___\n\n\n\n", "tags": [], "links": ["life-span development", "intelligence", "theory of mind", "cerebrum", "infant", "object permanence", "ethics", "breastfeeding", "cognition", "psychology"]}, {"title": "isomer", "text": "---\naliases: [isomerase, isomerize]\ntags: [chemistry]\n---\n# Isomers\n---\n**Isomers** are two [[molecule|molecules]] that have the same [[chemical formulae]], but have a different *arrangement* of the atoms in space.

Most importantly, from two [[allele|homozygous]] parents, we now had a completely [[allele|heterozygous]] generation of offspring.\n\n### F2\nIn the **second generation**, Medel crossed the F1 generation with themselves, and had some, perhaps counterintuitve results.

Their primary functions is to filter the [[blood]] of wastes, control [[fluid balance]], and [[electrolytes|electrolyte]] balance, and the overall chemical makeup of the blood.\n\nThe kidneys are [[peritoneum|retroperitoneal]], so the anterior surface of the kidney (adjacent to the outside edge of the perinephric fat layer) is the peritoneum. The kidneys are surrounded by four layers of connective tissue. From innermost to outermost they are the **fibrous capsule** (which directly adheres to the surface of the kidney, and also helps maintain the kidney's shape), the **perinephric fat** (which cushions the kidneys), the **renal fascia** (composed of dense irregular connective tissue that attaches the kidneys to the supporting structures), and the **perinephric fat** (which also cushions the kidneys).\n\n>[!science] That's a lot!\nThe kidneys filter the blood 60x a day, or have 200L of blood pass through them a day!\n\n## Anatomy\nEach kidney is largely bean shaped, with an artery, a vein and a ureter attached to the middle part.

This cleansing is carried out by the main functional unit of the kidneys, the [[nephron]]. \n\nGenerally speaking, the kidneys want to conserve as much water as possible as early humans would not have had a steady supply of clean water. \n\n### Secondary Functions of the Kidneys\nThe kidneys maintain **fluid balance** by both retaining fluid when we have lower blood volume and expelling fluid when we have a higher blood volume.

The changes in membrane potential are due to the flow of charged [[ion|ions]] in and out of the cell through special [[channel proteins]] that are chemically or electrically gated. Action potentials, once started, cannot stop until they have completed\u2014this is called the \"all-or-nothing\" principal. \n\nTo trigger an action potential, a cell's [[membrane potential]] must reach a certain threshold called the **threshold potential**. Most excitable cells need some sort of outside stimulus for this to happen, but the the [[autorhythmic cells]] can generate one all on their own.\n\n## Sequence\nThe exact sequence of events, ion concentrations, gated channels, voltages etc. vary from type of cell to type of cell, but action potentials follow a general sequence regardless of what type of cell is doing it.\n\n**Phase 1: Resting**\nThis is the cell *before* being stimulated, at it's [[resting membrane potential]]. It's ion concentrations are generally:\n\n- high *intra*cellular [[potassium|K+]]\n- high *extra*cellular [[sodium|Na+]]\n\n![[resting potential ions.png]]\n\n[[chloride|Cl-]] is also present, but does not play an important role in action potentials.\n\nSodium and potassium diffuse down their concentration gradient though [[channel proteins#Leak Channels|leak channels]], but the [[sodium-potassium pump]] keeps that gradient from flattening out.\n\nThe combination of ion concentrations keeps inside of the membrane is negative compared the outside, generally somewhere around -60mv to -90 mv, which is **polarized**. If something brings the membrane potential *less* polar (i.e. *more* positive, or *more* neutral) it is *depolarizing*. If something brings the membrane potential *more* polar (i.e. *more* negative, or *less* positive), then it is *hyperpolarizing*.\n\n**Phase 2: Stimulation**\nThe cell is stimulated in some fashion which raises it's membrane potential to the **threshold potential**. At this point the action potential fires, and there is no way to interrupt it until it's finished.\n\n**Phase 3: Depolarization**\nWhen the threshold is reached, membrane-bound [[channel proteins#Gated Channels|voltage-gated]] [[sodium|Na+]] channels open. They have been leaking in through leak channels, but not enough as they really want so when the voltage-gated channels open the come rushing in and spike the [[membrane potential]], usually to somewhere around +30mv or +40mv.\n\n**Phase 4: Repolarization**\nAt the peak of depolarization the [[sodium|Na+]] channels inactivate (and stay [[#Refractory Periods|inactivated]]) and [[channel proteins#Gated Channels|voltage-gated]] [[potassium|K+]] channels activate. This allows K$^+$ to rush out of the cell, dropping the [[membrane potential]] back down again.\n\n**Phase 5: Hyperpolarization**\nThe [[channel proteins#Gated Channels|voltage-gated]] K$^+$ channels stay open even after the membrane potential has reached it's original resting potential, which brings the membrane potential *more* negative than it's RMP, or, makes it **hyperpolarized**.\n\n**Phase 6: Regaining RMP**\nAfter the brief hyperpolarization phase, the membrane reaches it's [[resting membrane potential|RMP]] once again. Although the membrane potential has reached the RMP, the relative concentrations of ions is not the same as it was before the action potential. The [[sodium-potassium pump]] will work to reestablish the proper relative concentrations. From stimulation to the recovery of RMP varies, but in most non-specialized cells it is about 4-5 milliseconds.\n\n![[action potential.png]]\n\n## Refractory Periods\nThere are two important periods that affect the cell's ability to generate sequential action potentials, which are the **absolute refractory period** and the **relative refractory period**.\n\nThe **absolute refractory period** is the period of time during which the same cell *cannot* be affected by additional stimuli no matter how strong that stimuli is. It is very brief, usually only lasting 1 millisecond. When the [[channel proteins#Gated Channels|voltage-gated Na+ channels]] close at the peak of the depolarization, they become inactivated\u2014or basically locked close. Since opening these channels is how action potentials begin, there is no way to start a new one until they return to their resting state when the [[membrane potential]] repolarizes.\n\nThe absolute refractory period allows action potentials to conduct along the plasma membrane in only one direction. Without it it could cause a runaway self-sustaining loop.\n\nThe **relative refractory period** is the period of time after the absolute refractory period (when the depolarizing membrane potential reaches it's RMP) and lasts until the the end of the hyperpolarization state. During this time subsequent action potentials are possible, but require a stronger stimulus to initiate than the initial one.\n\n## Conduction\nAction potentials **conduct** from one end of the membrane to the other. In neurons they begin at one end of the axon and terminate at the other end. As the action potential is localized in a very small area, the depolarization immediately triggers more action potentials along the membrane nearby, and so on and so forth. Recall the [[channel proteins#Gated Channels|voltage-gated]] Na+ channels are inactivated until the repolarizing phase ends, forcing the conduction to move in only one direction.\n\n![[continuous conduction.png]]\n\nThis type of conduction is called **continuous conduction**. Myelinated [[neurons]] can perform a faster, more complicated type of conduction called [[neurons|saltatory conduction]].\n\n## Action Potential Variations\nNot all action potentials are the same, they vary depending on their function. They fire at a different rate at different places.\n\n- [[neurons|neuron]] action potentials take about 4ms to complete a cycle.\n- [[skeletal muscle]] action potentials take about 2ms to complete a cycle.\n- [[autorhythmic cells]] produce *pacemaker* potentials  in the heart stimulate their own action potentials with the use of [[channel proteins|leak channels]].\n- [[cardiac muscle]] cells have a plateau phase that prevents [[muscle twitch|tetany]]. This allows the chambers of the heart to fill back up with blood before they pump again.\n\t- Ca++ channels stay open during the plateau. When they close that is the end of the **absolute refractory period**\n\n![[action potential comparison.png]]\n\n---", "tags": ["Gated", "Leak", "Refractory"], "links": ["sodium", "neurons", "muscle fibers", "autorhythmic cells", "chloride", "potassium", "channel proteins", "sodium-potassium pump", "muscle twitch", "cardiac muscle", "membrane potential", "ion", "skeletal muscle", "resting membrane potential"]}, {"title": "publish homepage", "text": "---\naliases: [home, FAQ]\ntags: [meta]\n---\n# Welcome to *Chromatically*!\n---\nHello and welcome to *chromatically*, my published Obsidian vault!

Chromatically is for me. I realize that sounds a little contradictory (it lives in the internet, after all), but it's true. If you're here and find it useful for whatever reason, that's great! But that's not really why I've made it. Its real job is twofold: Firstly, it helps me study. I've found the act of writing down the course material in a way that is logical, clear and accurate has been *the single most effective method* for me to really *understand* what I'm studying. I could wax poetic on this topic for ages, but I think it best to leave it there for now. Secondly this vault is for me-ten-years-from-now. I want be able to think \"Oh right, I remember learning this in school, what was it again?\" and be able to look it up in a way that *makes sense to my brain*, and read it in a way that is written *exactly how my brain understands it*. \n\nI set up this Obsidian publish site on a bit of a lark\u2014and as exercise in \"working with the garage door open\" as they say. It was never meant to be *for* anyone besides myself, but I think it will push me to keep it a little bit more polished. I love [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and love nerding out about it, so I've put this out there for posterity and/or a way to share my vault with other Obsidian enthusiasts (Obsidianites?). I *think* this vault will be much more interesting for PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) enthusiasts instead of fellow nursing (or any nursing-adjacent) students, but it helps anyone in any capacity I'm happy!\n\n>[!question]- Where do I start?\nAnywhere you like! Here are the main pages for the main subjects I have. Some of them are typed up nice, but some of them are really more like placeholders.\n>\n> - [[nursing]] (This is ostensibly the homepage of the whole vault, but in an of itself isn't actually very interesting. It's more of a jumping off point. If I've done it right, you should be able to click the first link of any page, then keep following the first links and eventually land back on [[nursing]] every time.)\n>- [[chemistry]]\n>- [[biology]]\n>- [[microbiology]]\n>- [[nutrition]]\n>- [[anatomy & physiology]]\n>- [[mathematics]]\n>- [[physics]]\n>\n>Or, you can scroll down the left-hand side and click on what interests you. Hopefully it's not just a placeholder note...but it might be!\n>\n>Enjoy!\n\n## PKM Philosophy\nThere are some common PKM conversations that are had over certain topics, so I'll leave some of my philosophy here. I'd love to chat with you on PKM and Obsidian\u2014ping me\u2014or jump in the channels\u2014on the Obsidian Discord server.\n\n> [!question]- Where are the folders in the navigation bar?\nThere are none. I really don't use them, and I have no problem by simply searching for whatever I'm looking for by name using quick switcher. I make heavy use of aliases to make sure I can find what I'm looking for...and if I ever have a problem finding something in one keyword, that's a sign i've done something wrong. I do things wrong a lot, and only realize when I look back and think *what was I thinking?*. Most of the time adding an appropriate alias, or splitting one note into two fixes the problem. Folders would not help this, and would be much more work for next to no benefit.\n>\nI'll give an example. If I know I made a lot of notes on Obsidian, and I open up quick switcher and type in \"obsidian\", and my notes on Obsidian aren't there, that's a problem. In this case I usually search manually to find where I *did* put those notes. Say I find them in a note called `[[note making]]`. In this case I'll either add  `aliases: [obsidian]` to that note, or refactor my Obsidian-specific notes in their own new note, whichever makes more sense.\n>\nUnfortunately for my internet visitors, this system doesn't really help you when navigating this vault\u2014you sort of need to know what's in here already for that to be useful. Sorry! This is why I've made the list of notes visible on the left-hand side. At least you can browse note titles to get the gist of what's in here.  If you're ever lost search for \"home\" or click the \"chromatically\" in the top left and that will take you back here. Searching in the search bar also gives you an insight into what aliases I use, if you're into that sort of thing. (If you do search you might notice that many note titles seem to pop up twice. This is because I use H1 as the title of my note for formatting endorphins, do it's unavoidable.)\n\n>[!question]- Where are your tags?\n>Hidden in my YAML. I actually don't have much use for them at the moment, but I think future-Chromatic might want them so I only really put some in to save her a total headache.\n\n> [!question]- What plugins do you use?\n> I run pretty bare bones, but I've been finding more and more useful plugins. In vague order of most important to least:\n> - **Spaced Repetition** for anything I want to learn by rote (you'll see them scattered around if you look at the notes I'm currently learning).\n> - **Tasks** for keeping track of due dates and also when I want to work on them. (if I just track due dates, I do everything on that date. Not ideal.) You probably won't see these tasks, as they're typically in my Meta folder that's not on publish.\n> - **Dataview** to keep track of *notes* I want/need to work on. I was using Tasks for this, but it was starting to become unmanageable. You also won't see this as it's all in YAML metadata.\n> - **Linter** to tidy up my formating. Never realized how useful this might be before I started it.\n> - **Kanban** as a way to track my learning (but to be honest, that system needs work, I might give up on it/try to think of something better). \n\n>[!question]- Is this all you use Obsidian for?\nNope! It is by far my more polished vault, but I also have a catch-all Second Brain vault and one I use for creative writing.

That pyruvate is moved into the [[mitochondria]] where it undergoes the intermediate step of **[[pyruvate processing]]**, which produces a molecule called [[acetyl CoA]].

Most often carriers develop a dry cough as the virus progresses and symptoms worsen until natural breathing is restricted. COVID-19 can cause a variety of serious conditions including [[cough|severe cough]], [[pneumonia]], [[Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome]], [[kidneys|kidney]] failure, [[respiratory system|respiratory]] failure, and impaired [[liver]] function.\n\nOther symptoms include:\n- [[fatigue]]\n- muscle and body aches [[pain]]\n- [[headache]]\n\t- often one of the first symptoms, and lingers\n- [[dizziness]]\n- new loss of taste/smell\n- [[sore throat]]\n- [[congestion]] or [[runny nose]]\n- [[nausea]] or [[emesis|vomiting]]\n- [[diarrhea]]\n- confusion\n- behavioral changes\n- CVA\n\n## Structure of the Virus\nSars-CoV-2 is an [[virus#Envelope and Matrix|enveloped virus]] that uses [[RNA]] as it's nucleic acid. \n\n![[Sars-CoV-2 structure.png]]\n\n### Genes\nSars-CoV-2 only has 9 genes (compared with a human who has about 10,000!). However, with only 9 genes it can produce around 24 different proteins through a process called *ribosomal frameshifting*. This allows the virus to make the most out of what it has. Ribosomal frameshifting involves intentionally skipping one or two nucleotides after it has encoded the start codon. It's likely that it can only do this due to having +RNA.\n\n### Spike Glycoproteins\nThe spike glycoproteins on the outside of Sars-CoV-2 are what it uses to enter the human cells. (I can figure out if it uses [[animal virus#Membrane Fusion|membrane fusion]], or [[animal virus#Induced Endocytosis|endocytosis]], but it looks like coronaviruses in general use endocytosis.) The spike glycoproteins bind to the ACE2 receptors on the host cell, although first they do need to be activated by the TMPRSS2 proteins, also found on the host cell membrane. This will give it the right shape and allow it to bind on. A lot of [[#potential treatments]] of Sars-CoV-2 involve these spike proteins, and preventing them from binding to our ACE2 proteins.\n\n![[Sars-CoV2 binding to host cell.png]]\n\n## ACE2\n**ACE2** receptors are a type of [[membrane proteins|membrane protein]] that some of our cells have. The cells that have them include:\n- Type II alveolar cells in the lungs\n- GI tract\n- Goblet cells in the nasal passage\n- endothelial cells lining blood vessels.\n\nIt also turns out that older people have more ACE2 receptors in their lungs, making them more susceptible to the virus.\n\n## Potential Treatments\n### Soluble ACE2\nThe **soluble ACE2** treatment involves getting a bunch of free-floating soluble ACE2 into the extracellular space, to act as \"decoy receptors\" that cap all the spike glycoproteins and render them inoperable.\n\n![[soluble ACE2.png]]\n\n### Monoclonal Antibodies\n**Monoclonal antibody** are [[antibody|antibodies]] that are made in a lab, and the monoclonal antibody COVID treatment involves using these for Sars-CoV-2 that will all glomb onto the spike glycoproteins and render them useless.\n\n### Remdesivir\n**Remdesivir** is an antiviral medicine that is already developed, which doesn't stop it from entering a cell, but does make it more difficult for it to make copies of it's RNA once its there.\n\n## The Variants\nWhy do some viruses, like Sars-CoV-2 undergo genetic change so rapidly? Well, one reason is that Sars-CoV-2, being an [[virus#Nucleic Acids|RNA virus]] uses [[RNA polymerase]] to copy it's genetic code, and RNA polymerase lacks an ability to proofread. So, if it makes a mistake during copying, that mistake stays around. RNA viruses generally have a relatively high mutation rate, like the influenza virus. (Fortunately for us, although COVID-19 mutates faster than DNA virus, it doesn't mutate as fast as influenza.) \n\n![[Sars-Cov-2 mutations.png]]\n\n|  | mutation #1 | mutation #2 | mutation #3 | other spike mutation\n-------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------------:\n **UK** (B.1.17)|            |             |             |      \u2713      |\n **South Africa** (B.1.351)  |      \u2713      |     \u2713       |      \u2713      | \n **Brazil** (P1)             |      \u2713      |     \u2713       |      \u2713      |\n **New York** (B.1.525)      |             |             |      \u2713      |          \u2713\n **California** (B.1.427)    |             |             |             |          \u2713             \n \n ### How do These Variants Effect Treatment/Immunity\n As it turns out, once someone has gotten one of the above strain, and they get a new strain with only one variation, they still have a pretty good immunity against it. Once there are three different mutations, then we see that there it is harder for our antibodies to bind to the spike proteins. It's about 3x harder.

When a concentration gradient exists, there is a net movement *away* from regions of high concentration *towards* regions of low concentration. In other words this results in an increase in [[entropy]]. Recall that even at [[equilibrium]] movement does not stop, but continues to move back and forth, resulting in a lack of *net* change. \n\nIf there is a difference in concentrations of a particular solute on either side of a [[plasma membrane#Semipermeable Membrane|semipermeable membrane]], and that solute *cannot* diffuse across, but water *can*, then in order to even out the concentrations water *will* move in the direction of the higher solute concentration.

Salt water has a higher osmolarity than fresh water. \n\nA solution is **hyperosmotic** if it exerts more pressure, or has a higher concentration of particles. A hyperosmotic solution has a greater concentration of solute. If a cell from a salt water fish is placed in a beaker of fresh water, the cell is said to be hyperosmotic to the water\n\nA solution is **hypoosmotic** if it exerts less pressure, or has a lower concentration of particles.

The two strands our bound together sugar to phosphate, sugar to phosphate all the way down, forming two long \"backbone\" structures. The two strands are bond to *each other* by hydrogen bonds between their complementary nitrogenous bases.\n\nThis arrangement is very simple and very secure.\n## Function\nAn (vastly) oversimplified overview of DNA's function is that, for every [[protein]] that a cell or organism makes in order to live its life, there is a segment of DNA called a [[gene]] that is arranged in such a way that forms a [[codon|code]] that [[RNA polymerase|other molecules]] can [[transcription|read]] and then those molecules send [[mRNA|a copy]] of that code to yet *another* [[ribosome|molecule]] that can then [[translation|make the protein]]. All the proteins ultimately serve the purpose to allow the DNA time, space and energy to replicate again.\n\nThis overarching process is called the [[central dogma of biology]].\n\n\n\n## Why is DNA So Special?\n The continuity of life depends on its genetic information being accurately [[DNA replication|replicated]] over and over and over and over again. DNA is so good at this because despite the complexity and vastness of information that it holds, it is *very simple and very stable*.\n \n It may not seem simple\u2014a [[chromosome]] of DNA is the largest molecule in our bodies\u2014yet it is comprised of only 4 different types of [[nucleotide|building blocks]]. And those building blocks are arranged in a perfectly repetitive pattern\u2014meaning there is no variation in the chain of one nucleotide after another all the way down. \n \n DNA is also incredibly stable. When not being actively [[DNA replication|replicated]] or [[transcription|transcribed]], it just sort of sits there.\n \n ## DNA Replication\n**[[DNA replication]]** is one of, if not *the* most fundamental process in the whole of biology. It amazingly complex and *stunningly accurate*. Consistently (mostly) accurate replication is just about the single strongest [[evolution|evolutionary imparative]] there is (for certain organisms, like humans). The replication process only makes about one mistake per *billion* nucleotides. Mistakes do, of course, happen but\u2014despite being potentially deadly\u2014they are not always a bad thing. This is how random [[mutation|mutations]] come about, and these are a necessary function during [[evolution]].\n \n DNA replicates by **semiconservative replication**. This means that each strand is used as a template to make one new strand, resulting in two new whole molecules of DNA, each one with an \"original\" parent strand and one \"new\" daughter strand.\n\n![[semiconservative replication.png]]\n\n## Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic DNA\nEvery organism has DNA, but there are significant differences in between how prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes are coded into the DNA. [[Prokaryotic DNA]] is circular, and the [[gene|genes]] are sometimes found in groups that are all transcribed together called [[prokaryotic DNA|operons]].\n\nEukaryotic DNA is linear and arranged in [[chromosome|chromosomes]] %%#verify all eukaryotes%%.

If we *can* make them, (through a process called [[transamination]]) then they are **non-essential**, but if we *can't*, or we can't make *enough* of them, then they are **essential** amino acids. \n\n## Metabolism & The Amino Acid Pool\nAmino acids can be metabolized by first getting rid of their [[amine group]] by a process called [[deamination]], and then converting the remaining structure from there.\n\nThe [[protein turnover#The Amino Acid Pool|amino acid pool]] is the ready and available pool of amino acids that the body can draw on to make new proteins. Amino acids from degraded proteins, as well as those from proteins that we eat go into the pool.\n\n## Structure\nThe **structure of amino acids** is four components built around a **central carbon**. Three of the four components are the same for all amino acids, and the fourth one is what makes each one unique. The common components are a hydrogen, an [[functional group#Biologically Important Functional Groups|amine]] (amino-) and a [[carboxyl group]] (-acid). The fourth, special component is the **R-group** or **side chain**.\n\nAmino acids are all [[isomer|isomeric]] meaning you can build each amino acid in two fundamentally different directions around the central carbon. They are called L and D isomers. Naturally occurring amino acids are L isomers, but a D amino acid is a possibility for every amino acid. Sometimes an enzyme can completely change the structure of a protein by changing an L amino acid to a D one. \n\n![[amino acid.png]]\n\n### Properties of Amino Acid R-Groups\nAmino acids are defined by their R-groups, whose properties vary extensively. Some are polar, some are nonpolar; some are positively charged and some are negatively charged; and some have special properties, such as containing sulfur in order to help shape the protein.\n\n![[amino acid properties.png]]\n\n#### Polar or Nonpolar\n**Nonpolar side chains** are pretty common and are generally for non-specific jobs. They live in the middle of the proteins to push the water out. Generally speaking, if a [[point mutation]] causes one nonpolar amino acid to be exchanged for a different nonpolar one, it ends up being not that much of a problem.\n\n**Polar side chains** are generally used for specific jobs. They live on the outsides of proteins, and interact with the cytoplasmic environment where they live.\n\n#### Charged or Uncharged\n**Electrically [[charge]] side chains** tend to be more involved in actually catalyzing reactions. They have very specific effects on enzymes and catalyze reactions. They can even interact with each other on opposite sides of the proteins during folding.\n\nA positive and negative charged amino acid can form an [[ionic bond]].\n\nNegatively charged side chains may be considered acidic, while positively charged ones may be considered basic.\n\n#### Special Cases\nThere are three **special side chains** that have unique characteristics. **Proline** has the ability to attach to the [[amine group]], which forms a ring or a bend. **Cysteine** has a sulfhydryl (\u2014S\u2014H) which can form a *disulfide bond* with another one in the chain. They can be very important for the stability of a protein's [[protein structure]]. **Methionine** is special because it is just used for being the first amino acid placed during [[translation]], which may or may not be removed afterwards.\n\n## Free Amino Acids are Zwitterionic\nThe **[[zwitterion|zwitterionic]]** state of amino acids is when the amino acid has both the acid and base properties. The amino group will accept a proton in water, and the [[carboxyl group|carboxylic acid]] will donate a proton, so these amino acids are fully charged and oppositely charged in water. When they are put in water, they become ionized, allowing them to dissolve. This goes away, as you assemble the amino acids into proteins Once the amino acid is in water, and the proton transfer is complete, and all of the properties of the amino acid are dependent on the side chain. \n\nEven nonpolar individual amino acids do tend to be charged at *both ends*, where the [[amine group]] and [[carboxyl group]] are. This is important because many amino acids are hydrophobic, meaning they won't really dissolve in water. (Okay, I forget what that means exactly, or why that's important). \n\nFree amino acids are always in a zwitterionic state.\n\n## Guide to The Twenty Common Amino Acids\n![[amino acid guide.png]]\n___\n", "tags": ["The", "Biologically"], "links": ["protein structure", "zwitterion", "amine group", "transamination", "carboxyl group", "isomer", "point mutation", "ionic bond", "charge", "translation", "protein", "essential and non-essential amino acids", "deamination"]}, {"title": "cerebellum", "text": "---\naliases: [proprioception, muscle memory, arbor vitae]\ntags: [a&p, nervous]\n---\n# The Cerebellum\n---\nThe **cerebellum** is a part of the [[brain]] that is largely involved in maintaining **proprioception**, or the [[sense]] of understanding where some part of your body is in relationship to the rest of the body, and your surroundings.

Secondly, they can actuually release [[antimicrobial substances]] that can kill off pathogens.\n\n### Our Immune System Protects Normal Microbiota\n#### Differentiating Between Normal Microbiota and Pathogens\nOur bodies have evolved to recognize and protect our normal microbiota. One way of doing this is the cells of our [[intestines]] can differentiate between normal microbiota and pathogens, because of the placement of their [[toll-like receptor|toll-like receptors]]. Their TLRs are located inside their cytoplasm *and* on the basolateral side, but not on the \"top\" side. As normal microbiota just live on the top, and do not enter or pass through the intestinal cells, they do not engage those TLRs.\n\n#### Normal Microbiota Can Activate Regulatory T-Cells\n[[Regulatory T-cells]] are responsible for turning down the immune response, so it is beneficial for our helpful bacteria to be able to activate the T$_{regs}$ for their own protection. They can activate the T$_{regs}$ directly or indirectly.\n\n##### Activating Regualtory T-Cells Driectly\nNormal microbiota can engage a [[regulatory T-cells|regulatory T-cell's]] [[toll-like receptor]] and then stay engaged continiously.

A grand theory is comprehensive, and seek to explain the whole of human experience. Despite their name, they are not considered the end all and be all by modern psyychologists. \n\nThe grand theories are:\n- **psychoanalytic theory**, first conceptualized by Sigmund Freud which described human behavior in terms of significant factors from childhood\n- [[psychosocial theory]] first conceptualized by Erik Erikson, a contemporary of Freud, which took more holistic, life-long view of development\n- **behaviorism** first conceptulaized by B. F. Skinner, which saw human behavior as fundamentally learned through reinforcement\n- [[cognitive theory]] first conceptualized by Jean Piaget, which sought to understand human behavior as fundamentally dependent on how one thinks, or views the world.\n\nThe **not-so-grand** theories:\n- sociocultural theory\n- universal theory\n\n\n___", "tags": [], "links": ["life-span development", "psychosocial theory", "cognitive theory", "nursing"]}, {"title": "bone remodeling", "text": "---\naliases: [resorption]\ntags: [a&p, musculoskeletal]\n---\n# Bone Remodeling\n---\n**Bone remodeling** is the stage of [[bone]] development that takes over after [[interstitial growth]] and [[appositional growth]] finish, and continues for the rest of our lives. It is the constant process of breaking down old or fractured bone and building up new ones. It doesn't ever really stop, but the ratio of breaking down to building up peaks around age 30 and starts an inevitable decline by 40. Roughly 5-10 percent of the skeleton is remodeled annually.\n\nThe body responds to mechanical stresses that it does or does not undergo and remodels the bones accordingly. If there is a lot of mechanical stress this stimulates the deposition of mineral salts (hydroxyapatites?) and [[collagen]] fibers; if there is not as much mechanical stress it stimulates the bones to get rid of those things. This is why astronauts loose bone mass during time spent in microgravity. Resistance [[physical activity|exercise]] has been proven to slow or reverse the loss of bone density, even and especially as we age. It can even prevent [[osteoporosis]].\n\n**Resorption** is the process of *breaking down* bones matrix, during which osteoclasts break down the bone surface with acid and specific enzymes. Resorption happens all the time. It can be used to [[bone repair|repair fractures]] or to release [[calcium]] into the bloodstream.

In humans we have 6 billion base pairs, and only end up having 5 or 6 mistakes per replication. \n\nThe placement of the error is completely random, so if they're in a really sensitive place like in a [[tumor suppressor gene]], that's a huge problem.

The ETC is the name for the group of molecules found in inner membrane of the [[mitochondria]] that [[redox|oxidize]] the [[electron carrier|electron carriers]] that have been built up during the previous three steps of cellular respiration and use them to power massive [[ATP]] generation.\n\nThe ETC uses \"electron transport\" to shuffle electrons down the line, each step harnessing its energy to pump [[hydrogen ion|protons]] into the intermembrane space, creating a [[concentration gradient]] that produces a [[osmosis|chemiosmotic]] force to power the final step, [[ATP synthase|ATP synthesis]].\n\nOxygen is an absolutely vital component for the ETC  in order to accept the electron at the end of it. For each single molecule of glucose, 6 O$_2$ molecules are requried at the end of the ETC. \n\n## Free Energy in NADH and FADH2: Powering the ETC\nUp to this point, the reactions of cellular respiration have really been keen on producing the high energy molecules [[NAD|NADH]] and [[FAD|FADH2]]. They have massive amounts of free energy in these forms, and it's that free energy that powers the ETC. \n\n![[free energy in cellular respiration.png]]\n\n## Structure\nDivided into 4 protein complexes. These complexes go back and forth from being oxidized and being reduced. At the end of the day, that electron has to go somewhere, and if it has no where to go (i.e. there is no oxygen around), then it gets backed up. If it gets paced up the electrons can't flow through the system, and the protons can't be pumped into the intermembrane space.\n\n![[ETC (mitochondria).png]]\n\n### Complexes\n#### Complexes as Protein Pumps\nThree out of the four complexes pump protons into the [[mitochondria|mitochondrial intermembrane space]] in order to build up a concentration gradient to power the [[ATP synthase]].\n\n#### Complexes are Redox Centers\nProton pumping requires energy. The protein complexes gets this energy from a series of internal [[redox]] reactions using the electrons that were harvested from the earlier steps of respiration. Once the electron has passed through a particular complex, it is passed out of the complex either by a membrane [[#electron carriers]] or by shoving it into a final electron acceptor, O$_2$\n\n#### Complex I\n**Complex I** pumps protons into the intermembrane space. It gets its electron from [[NAD|NADH]] and passes it to [[coenzyme Q]] so it can be then passed over to [[#complex III]].\n\n#### Complex II\n**Complex II** does not pump protons directly, but assists complexes [[#Complex III|III]] and [[#Complex IV|IV]] to do so. It gets its electron from [[FAD]] and passes it to [[coenzyme Q]] so it can be then passed over to [[#complex III]].\n\n#### Complex III\n**Complex III**, also known as \"cytochrome c reductase\" pumps protons into the intermembrane space. It gets its electron from [[coenzyme Q]] and passes it to [[#cytochrome c]] so it can then be passed to [[#complex IV]].\n\n#### Complex IV\n**Complex IV**, also known as \"cytochrome c oxidase\", pumps protons into the intermembrane space. It gets its electron from [[#cytochrome c]] and passes it off to the final acceptor, O$_2$.\n\n### Electron Carriers\nThe **ETC electron carriers** are [[membrane proteins]] that ferry the electrons from one complex to the next. They're very specific to what type of complex they can bind to. **[[Coenzyme Q]]** is an electron carrier that ferries electrons all over the place. **Cytochrome *c*** is a membrane protein that ferries electrons from [[#complex III]] to [[#complex IV]]\n\n### ATP synthase\n[[ATP synthase]] is the protein complex that harnesses the [[proton motive force]] from the concentration gradient from the proton pumps to generate massive amounts of [[ATP]].\n\n## Function\nIn each complex [[atom|electrons]] pass from a molecule with a lower [[redox]] potential to one with a higher redox potential. As electrons move down through the chain, they are held more and more tightly in the newly formed bonds, and the potential energy in each successive bond lessens. The protein complexes use the energy given off in these reactions to pump protons into the inner membrane space to create that much-needed electrochemical gradient. \n\nUltimately, the goal of the chain is to create a electro-chemical [[concentration gradient|gradient]] with many protons in the intermembrane space to drive the synthesis of [[ATP]] through [[osmosis|chemiosmosis]] that drives [[ATP synthase]].\n\nNADH and FADH2 kick a bunch of protons into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria through specialized protein channels, then lets them back in through [[ATP synthase]], which is a spinning wheel proton that just churns out the ATP. It does this by squeezing some [[functional group#Phosphate|inorganic phosphate]] and [[ATP|ADPs]] together, which is an important distinction from [[phosphorylation]], which we have seen in the previous steps of [[cellular respiration]].\n___", "tags": ["electron", "complex", "Phosphate", "cytochrome", "Complex"], "links": ["electron carrier", "ATP synthase", "ATP", "proton motive force", "osmosis", "redox", "NAD", "cellular respiration", "concentration gradient", "hydrogen ion", "FAD", "atom", "membrane proteins", "electron transport chain", "phosphorylation", "mitochondria"]}, {"title": "flagella", "text": "---\naliases: [basal body, motor protein, hook, running and tumbling]\ntags: [biology, microbiology, cell]\n---\n# Flagella\n---\n**Flagella** (plural: flagellum) are hairlike filaments that are found on the outside of some [[prokaryote|prokaryotes]] that allow for motility in a liquid environment. They can either go in a circular motion (clockwise or counter clockwise, depending) for prokaryotes or in a side-to-side motion for eukaryotes.\n\n## Components\nThe three main components of a flagella is the [[#motor proteins]], the [[#basal body]],  the [[#hook]] and the [[#filament]]. The basal body, hook and filament all spin when the flagella is in motion.\n\n![[flagella.png]]\n\n### Motor Proteins\n The **flagellar motor** spans the inner and outer membrane of a gram-negative bacteria. Bacteria use a [[proton motive force]] to power the movement, and archaea and eukaryotes use [[ATP]] to power it.\n \n### Basal Body\nThe **basal body** of a flagella anchors the structure to the [[cell wall]] and [[plasma membrane|cytoplasmic membrane]]. The [[evolution|evolutionary]] precursor of the flagella were likely secretory bodies that resembles the basal body and [[#hook]] section of a flagella, owing to the fact that the proteins for the [[#filament]] are still secreted out of the cell though this section. \n\n### Hook\nThe **hook** of the flagella is a flexible curved segment that is in between the [[#Basal Body]] and the [[#fiament]].\n\n### Filament\nThe **filament** of the flagella is the threadlike part that extends way out into the cell's environment. It is made from protein.\n\nThe movement of the filament in prokaryotes is like a pinwheel, while eukaryotic flagella move side to side, like a whip.\n\n## Running and Tumbling\n**Running and tumbling** is a method of locomotion that some [[bacteria]] use to move towards nutrients or away from danger. It can be broken down into two stages, \"running\" and \"tumbling\". \n\nIn the running stage, the flagella rotate counterclockwise and the bacteria just runs straight forward. In the tumbling stage the flagella rotate clockwise and enter their tumble, where they just spin around and around. When the exit the tumble, they are facing a completely random direction, and begin running agin. \n\nIf the bacteria sense that they are swiming towards food or away from danger, the running section will last much longer than if they are moving away from food or towards danger. This way the bacteria spend a longer net time moving in the direction they want, and if they have enough of a proton gradient they can move quite fast.\n___", "tags": ["fiament", "motor", "filament", "hook", "Basal", "basal"], "links": ["prokaryote", "ATP", "plasma membrane", "bacteria", "proton motive force", "cell wall", "evolution"]}, {"title": "synovial joint", "text": "---\naliases: [diarthrosis, joint cavity, synovial fluid, articular cartilage, articular capsule, bursae, fat pad, menisci, articular disk, hinge joint, plane joint, condyle joint, pivot joint, saddle joint, ball-in-socket joint]\ntags: [biology, a&p, joint]\n---\n# Synovial Joints\n---\n**Synovial joints** are a type of [[joint]] that allow the maximum possible movement, and they are the most common type found in the body. Chances are if you think of something as a \"joint\", you're thinking of a synovial joint. They are the only types of bones that are classified as [[joint#Structural Classifications|diarthroses]], or joints that are freely movable, and these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.\n\n[[knee]]\n\nUnfortunately there is an inverse relationship between range of motion and stability, and as the bones in synovial joints are not actually connected, it is possible that the joint can become [[joint dislocation|dislocated]], when the bones are pulled from the proper position. \n\nNotable synovial joints include:\n**In the skull\n- [[temporomandibular joint|TMJ]]\n**In the shoulder**\n- [[sternoclavicular joint]]\n- [[acromioclavicular joint]]\n- [[femoroacetabular joint]]\n**In the leg**\n- [[glenohumeral joint]]\n- the [[knee]]\n\n## Structure\nThe most notable distinguishing feature of synovial joints are the presence of a **joint cavity**, which is surrounded by an **articular capsule**[^1] and filled with **synovial fluid**. \n\n[^1]: \"joint\" and \"articular\" seem to be able to be used interchangeably, and I don't know why some phrases in my book use one and some use the other.\n\nThe joint cavity is lined by two structures: the bones inside the cavity are lined with a think layer of [[cartilage|hyaline cartilage]] called **articular cartilage**, and the rest of the cavity is lined with [[tissue membrane|synovial membrane]]. This membrane produces **synovial fluid**, which is a viscous and oily substance that performs three important functions: it acts as a *lubricant*, reducing friction between the bones; it acts as a *shock absorber* to distribute stresses evenly across the surfaces of the joint; and it *nourishes* the [[cartilage|chondrocytes]] of the articular cartilage and removes wastes. \n\n- [!]\\ Synovial fluid circulates in and out of the cartilage matrix when the joints are flexed, so this is an important activity for joint health.\n\nThe joint cavity is surrounded by the **articular capsule**, which is made up of the synovial membrane and an outer, **fibrous layer**. The fibrous layer is continuous with the [[bone|periosteum]]. \n\n![[synovial joint.png]]\n\n## Accessory Structures\nThere is a lot of movement that happens in synovial joints, and therefore a lot of protection and stabilization that needs to occur.\n\nFor protection there are *bursae*, *fat pads*, and *menisci*. **Bursae** are little sacs of synovial membrane that are full of synovial fluid positioned here and there. Likewise, **fat pads** are little fat pads of [[adipose tissue]]. **Menisci** or **articular disks** are little pads of [[cartilage|fibrocartilage]] that help both protect and stabilize the movement.\n\nFor stabilization there are both *intrinsic* and *extrinsic [[ligaments]]*. **Intrinsic ligaments** are extensions of the articular capsule itself, and **extrinsic ligaments** are completely outside of it. **[[Tendons]]** also stabilize the joint because they often pass across or around a joint, and can sometimes even limit the range of motion in the right place. Tendons are protected themselves by specialized bursae that wrap around them called **tendon sheaths**.\n\n## Types\n**Synovial joints** come in 6 types of structural configurations. \n\n- **Plane** joints are found between flat bones, like between the carpal bones.\n- **Hinge** joints are found places that just got in one direction, like at the elbow. One bone goes around the other.\n- **Condylar** joints are found where the joints have to go one direction but can also go side to side, like the knuckle joints.\n- **Saddle** joints are like condylar joints but offer even greater range of movement, like the thumb knuckle.\n- **Pivot** joints are where one bone rotates around another one, like how the [[vertebral column|atlas]] rotates around the dens of the [[vertebral column|axis]].\n- **Ball-and-socket** joints are the most mobile off all the synovial joints.

They are caused when people regular interruptions to their sleep patterns. For example, it's common to see this in night shift workers or people who experience jet lag often.

It is dependent on the **net filtration pressure**, or **NFP**.  If the NFP drops too low, the kidneys have a hard time filtering the blood. \n\nNFP is dependent on three factors, the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the blood, colloid [[osmosis|osmotic pressure]] and hydrostatic pressure from the filtrate already in the glomerular space. The blood hydrostatic pressure is largely dependent on the overall [[blood pressure]], but can be finely tuned by the diameter of the afferent and efferent [[glomerulus|arterioles]]. Colloid osmotic pressure is driven by the fact that plasma proteins are the strongest factor of determining osmotic pressure, and they are too large to fit through the filtration membrane, thus they stay inside the blood.\n\nCombining all these factors, we can calculate net filtration pressure in the glomerulus as:\n$$ HP_g - (OP_g + HP_c) = NFP $$\n\n![[GFR.png]]\n\n### GFR Regulation\nRegulating the GFR is essential for healthy kidney functions. **The normal GFR is roughly 120-125 ml/min**.\n\n- if GFR is too **slow**, the substances that need to be excreted end up getting reabsorbed, because it takes too long to get through the tubules.\n- if GFR is too **fast**, the substances that need to be reabsorbed end up getting excreted because there's not enough time in the tubules.\n\nThere are two real factors that the system corrects for: **changes in blood pressure** and **changes in blood osmolarity**. High blood pressure can be really damaging to the kidneys, and low blood pressure will not filter the blood at a good rate. Osmolarity can also affect GFR by changing the blood osmotic pressure, but also indicates a low blood volume.\n\n>[!health]- Detailed GFR regulation\n> ![[GFR regulation.png]]\n\n#### Intrinsic Controls\nThe **intrinsic controls**, or **renal autoregulation** are the ways in which the kidney itself can regulate the GFR. These are able to respond quickly to some fluctuation in blood pressure and osmolarity. This is actually happening *all the time*.\n\nEssentially, the intrinsic controls all come down to altering the diameter of the [[glomerulus|afferent arteriole]]. Recall that the afferent arteriole is generally larger than the [[glomerulus|efferent arteriole]], which helps it build up a high local pressure gradient. This is like the valve on a hose faucet. The more dilated the afferent arteriole, the more fluid can get in, the more fluid enters into the glomerulus, the higher the GFR. The efferent arteriole can also affect GFR by dilating and contracting, but generally this has much less influence on the the afferent arteriole.\n\nThere are two mechanisms of intrinsic control are the **myogenic response** and the **tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism**.\n\nThe **myogenic response** is when the afferent arteriole constricts in response to a rise in systemic [[blood pressure]], so that less blood can enter the glomerulus. \n\nThe **tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism** is when the macula densa cells of the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] sense an increase in tubular NaCl concentration, and signal the afferent arteriole to contract, we well as [[cell signaling|signaling]] the [[glomerulus|mesangial cells]] to contract, both of which decreases GFR.\n\n#### Extrinsic Controls\nThe **extrinsic controls** of maintaining a healthy GFR are slower than the intrinsic controls, but can compensate for larger fluctuations in blood pressure. These can be **neural** or **hormonal**.\n\nThe **neural controls** are the activation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], which triggers vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole and the [[glomerulus|mesangial cells]] of the glomerulus. \n\nThe hormonal controls consist of releasing [[renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system|renin]], [[antidiuretic hormone|ADH]] and [[renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system|aldosterone]] if the blood pressure is too low, and releasing [[atrial natriuretic peptide|ANP]] from the heart of it's too high.\n\n\n___", "tags": ["Filtration"], "links": ["nephron", "kidneys", "tubular reabsorption", "blood pressure", "osmosis", "renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system", "hydrostatic pressure", "sympathetic nervous system", "juxtaglomerular apparatus", "cell signaling", "atrial natriuretic peptide", "antidiuretic hormone", "plasma", "glomerulus", "renal tubule"]}, {"title": "plants", "text": "---\naliases: [central vacuole]\ntags: [biology]\n---\n# Plants\n---\nThe **plant** kingdom is in the domain [[eukaryote|eukaryota]].

The body works to bring any pathogens it can into the system, and leukocytes generally hang out there.\n\n![[lymphatic system.png]]\n\n## Components of the Lymphatic System\nThe lymphatic system is a network of vessels and organs, filled with lymph and other cells that work to clear the body of toxins and [[pathogen|pathogens]]. It is comprised of the lymphatic vessels and the lymphoid organs. \n\nThere are two types of lymphoid organs, the primary lymphoid organs and the secondary lymphoid organs.\n\n### Primary\nThe **primary lymphoid organs** are the [[bone marrow]] and [[thymus]]. This is where the [[white blood cells]] are produced, and many of them also mature here.  \n\n### Secondary\nThe **secondary lymphoid organs** is essentially all the rest of the system that is not the [[#primary lymphoid organs]], the [[pharynx|tonsils and adenoids]], [[lymph node|lymph nodes]], [[Peyer's patches]], [[spleen]], [[appendix]] and the lymphatic vessels. The secondary lymphoid organs are where the real battle occurs, where leukocytes become activated and fight the pathogens. These are found in the neck, armpits, groin and gut.\n\n##### MALT\nThe **mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue**, or MALT, is a subcategory of the [[#secondary lymphoid organs]] which are associated with mucosal surfaces: the breast, [[respiratory tracts]], [[genitourinary tract]] and the [[gastrointestinal tract|GI tract]].\n\n### Vessels\nThe **lymphatic vessels** are similar to [[blood vessels]] in that they transport lymph around the body. In addition to the main lymphatic vessels, there are also **lymphatic capillaries** that absorb fluid from the interstitial tissue, and also [[lacteals]], which are found in intestinal villi and are used to absorb [[lipid digestion#Absorption|digested lipids]].\n\n## How Fluid Enters Lymphatic System\nLymph and [[white blood cells]] enter the lymphatic vessels by either gradually seeping into the lymphatic vessels, or by joining up directly at lymph nodes.\n\n### Gradual Seep\nThe **gradual seep** method of entering the lymphatic system is when lymphatic components arrive in the lymphatic system by way of gradually seeping into it from the surrounding tissue. [[blood|Plasma]] from the blood seeps out of the [[cardiovascular system|capillaries]] and into the surrounding tissue. Once there it is considered [[body fluids#Intra Extracellular Fluids|interstitial fluid]]. From there it can then seep into the lymphatic capillaries, and it is then considered \"lymph\". [[White blood cells]] can enter the lymphatic system in much the same way, if the capillaries have loosened up enough for them to squeeze through. \n\n![[lymph formation.png]]\n\n### Direct Entry\nThe **direct entry** method of entering the lymphatic system happens at certain junctures when \"high endothelial venioles\" (or HEVs) connect directly with certain lymph nodes, the [[white blood cells]] can leave the circulatory system straight into the lymphatic system.\n\n## How Fluids Exit the Lymphatic System\nAt the end of of the lymphatic system's circulation, the whole thing gets dumped from the thoracic duct into the [[cardiovascular system]].

This works to establish a cell's negative charge.\n\nThe sodium-potassium pump is an incredibly important system in biology, and without it we cannot live long.

This is done by having the gene that codes for the repressor protein, *lacI*, always on. This regulator binds to the *operator* of the lac operon and physcially blocks [[RNA polymerase]] from moving forward to translate the operon.\n\nIf there is some lactose present in the environment (and a little bit can get in, even without galactoside permiase), that lactose actually binds to the repressor, causing it to release from the operator and allowing RNA polymersase to move along.\n\n### Positive Regulation\nBreaking down lactose is all well and good, but it turns out that [[glucose.png|glucose]] is actually *way* eaiser to metabolize. So, there's no real purpose of going through the trouble of turning on the lac operon if there is glucose just sitting there watiting to be used. So, even if there is lactose present (and thus the repressor protein has fallen off), if there is *also* glucose around, it's best if the lac operon remain off. \n\nIn order for [[RNA polymerase]] to latch onto the promoter for the lac operon, it can really use the help of of the CAP protein (catabolic activating protein). The CAP protein needs the help of [[second messengers|cAMP]], otherwise it won't be able to bind onto the DNA. When glucose levels are high, cAMP levels are low, which means the CAP protein will have a hard time binding to the DNA which means RNA polymerase will have a hard time binding to the DNA.

It is the core of what nurses do, and is happening in one way or another all the time, every day in a care setting. The five steps are **assessment**, **diagnosis** **planning**, **implementation**, and **evaluation**.\n\nAlthough it is described as five distinct stages that go in a particular order, that isn't necessarily always the case. The nurse is constantly using their [[clinical reasoning and clinical judgment]] to determine if the step they are \"on\" is appropriate, or if on needs to be revisited. This is important because each subsequent step depends on the accuracy of the previous one. \n\n## Assessment\nThe [[assessment]] step of the nursing process is the first thing a nurse will do when they get a new patient. This involves reviewing the chart, physically assessing the patient, and asking them questions to find out all the relevant information for care. Although this is the \"first\" step, the nurse is constantly assessing the patient to look out for changes in condition or anything else that would prompt a reassessment.\n\n## Diagnosis\nThe [[nursing diagnosis|diagnosis]] step of the nursing process occurs after the assessment, where the nurse decides what is going to be the focus of the care, both in the short term and in the long term. Although we use the same word, this is not to be confused with a medical diagnosis, which is something doctors provide. Doctors diagnose the primary underlying condition of a patient, and work to solve that root cause. Nurses diagnose the primary reason for care in a practical day-to-day scenario.\n\n## Planning\nThe **planning** step of the nursing process is where the nurse draws up the [[nursing care plan]]. This includes information from assessment and diagnosis, and what their best ideas for treating the patient are, and a goal to shoot for. When in a hospital or other health-care setting, there is often multiple problems that can and should be addressed, and the care plan reflects all of those individually. When determining what problem to treat first, the nurse typically thinks about it in terms of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], giving basic life-sustaining measures first, addressing physiological needs, and providing comfort before other treatments.\n\n## Implementation\nThe [[implementation]] step of the nursing process is where the care plan is actually carried out. The nurse can freely do any independent [[nursing interventions]], and may do any dependent interventions provided there is a [[provider|doctor's order]] in. This step may sound straightforward, but the nurse is actually constantly reassessing the patient and anticipating problems that may arise down the line. This step is also the one that involves most of the hands-on patient interaction, so another important aspect of this step is educating the patient, soliciting their help and participation, and [[documentation|documenting]] care.\n\n## Evaluation\nThe [[evaluation]] step of the nursing process is where the nurse determines whether or not the care plan was met or not (or even if it was only partially met). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n___", "tags": [], "links": ["implementation", "provider", "nursing diagnosis", "nursing interventions", "nursing", "Maslow's hierarchy of needs", "nursing care plan", "clinical reasoning and clinical judgment", "assessment", "documentation"]}, {"title": "pyruvate processing", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [biology, metabolism, nutrition]\n---\n# Pyruvate Processing\n---\n**Pyruvate processing**, or **pyrurvate oxidation** is a linking step in [[cellular respiration]] that follows [[glycolysis]] and proceeds the [[citric acid cycle]].

Using a special technique, the bacteria is isolated until it grows in it's own homogenous **colony**. It is quite difficult to tell just by looking if the colony was started by a single bacteria or a small cluster, so scientists count bacteria in terms of **colony-forming units** or **CFUs**.  \n\nGenerally speaking, to grow a culture the scientist takes some amount of bacteria from a **stock culture**, or a known source of cells that we want to work with, and **inoculates** a new medium with some of the cells from the stock culture. The cells beign transfered are called the **inoculum**. Depending on the type of media being worked with, scientists might use an **inoculating loop** or an **inoculating needle**.\n\n## The Media\nThe **medium** is like the \"soil\" that we want the bacteria to grow in. The soil needs all the required materioals fro bacteria to [[metabolism#Types of Metabolizers|metabolize]]. Things that the media require are:\n\n- an [[biological energy|energy]] source\n- an [[atom|electron]] source\n- a [[carbon]] source\n- a [[nitrogen]] source\n- [[oxygen|O2]], S and P sources.\n- [[mineral|metalic]] ions\n- [[vitamin|vitamins]] (optional as some bacteria can synthesize these)\n- [[water]] is the basis for all media\n\nWhen the exact concentration of each nutrient is known the medium is said to be \"chemically defined\" or \"synthetic.\" If it is not known it is said to be \"undefined\" or \"complex.\"\n\nMedia can be in one of three states: liquid, solid or semi-solid\n\n**Liquid medium** or \"broth\" is used to grow large numbers of bacteria in the shortest amount of time. Because it's so rapid, it also depleats the nutrients quickly and produces a large amount of waste.\n\n**Solid medium** is relatively common, and is made by from a gell-like substance called **agar**, a complex polysaccharide derived from red algea. Solid media can themselves have three shapes or forms: deeps, slants and plates.\n\nDeeps are primarily used as longer-term storage. Slants are also used for storage. Plates () have a large surface area, but don't have the umpfh for long term growth. \n\n**Semi-solid medium** contains a small amount of agar, but is still liquid at room temperature. This is used in special tests. \n\n## Aseptic technique\n**Aseptic technique** is a series of best practices for use in a microbiology lab that are used to maintain [[asepsis]] make sure we don't contaminate the culture we want to work with.\n\n### Contamination\n**Contamination** can come from many sources. Always asume that (unwanted) bacteria will:\n- fall from the air\n- attach to lids placed on a table/other surface\n- be transfered from your hands to any surface you touch\n- be transfered from an unsterilized loop or needle onto a sterile medium\n\n### Guidelines\nIn order to combat these intrustions we follow these guidelines:\n- Tabletops should be disinfected before and after *every* laboratory session.\n- Sterilize the entire wire section of an inoculating instrument in the \"Bacti-cinerator\" for 10 seconds before and after transferring bacteria with said instrument. Remember to wait a few seconds to cool it before using it.\n- Any medium that has been opened is considered contaminated, so only open when you are ready to transfer from a stock culture.\n- Only remove the cap of the tube for long enough to insert and remove the inoculating instrument when inoculating. Caps should not change hands or put down.\n- When opening a plate, open the lid only as much as needed (like a clam). I.e. don't take it all the way off\n- When holding an open tube, hold it an an angle so the area a bacteria can fall into is lessened.\n- After removing the cap of a tube, heat the lip of the tube by placing it at the opening of the Bacti-cinerator for a couple seconds. Repeat this when replacing the cap back on the tube. This creates a convection currenct above the culture or medium and prevents airborne contaminates from entering.\n___", "tags": ["Types"], "links": ["water", "nitrogen", "bacteria", "biological energy", "oxygen", "vitamin", "asepsis", "microbe", "mineral", "atom"]}, {"title": "clindamycin hydrochloride", "text": "---\naliases: []\ntags: [pharm]\n---\n# Clindamycin Hydrochloride\n---\n**Clindamycin** (klin-da-MYE-sin) **hydrochloride** is an [[antibiotics|antibiotic]]\n\n## Available Forms\n- **clindamycin hydrochloride**\n\t- Capsules:\u00a075 mg; 150 mg; 300 mg\n- **clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride**\n\t- Granules for oral solution:\u00a075 mg/5 mL\n- **clindamycin phosphate** (injection)\n\t- Infusion (premixed):\u00a0300 mg (50 mL); 600 mg (50 mL); 900 mg (50 mL)\n\t- Injection:\u00a0150 mg/mL; 300 mg/2 mL; 600 mg/4 mL; 900 mg/6 mL\n\n## Indications\n[[infection|Infections]] caused by sensitive staphylococci, [[Streptococcus|streptococci]], pneumococci,\u00a0*Bacteroides*, *Fusobacterium*, *Clostridium perfringens*, or other sensitive aerobic and anaerobic organisms\n\n## Counterindications & Cautions\n-   Contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to drug or lincomycin.

When they were first discovered they were found to be \"complementing the activity of antibodies,\" which they do, but it turns out they can do more than just that as well.\n\n## Functions\nComplement proteins circulate your system in their inactive form until they are activated by certain stimuli. Each protein has a specilized funtion, and a lot of them help *other* cells do their jobs better. Some things they can do are:\n- Coat the surface of an invading cell to trigger and assist with [[phagocytosis]].\n- Bind to our own cells to cause [[inflammation]].\n- Directly attack bacterial cells by makeing holes in their membranes.\n\nThere are nine major proteins and they're named C1-C9 (named in the order of their discovery). \n\n## C3\nThe cleaving of the **C3** complement protein is what the whole system revolves around. Once C3 is cleaved, the [[#complement protein cascades]] are kicked off. Cleaving C3 produces C3a and C3b. C5 binds to C3b, which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. C6, C7, C8 and C9 can all bind to C5b to form the [[#C5b C6 C7 C8 C9 The Membrane Attack Complex|membrane attack complex]].\n\n## C3b\nThe **C3b** complement protein coats bacterial cells and acts as an [[opsonin]].\n\n## C5a, C3a\nThe **C5a** and **C3a** complement proteins bind to [[mast cells]] and [[basophils]], causing them to release [[histamine]], which kicks off [[inflammation]]. Alternately, they can also bind to to [[neutrophils]] which prompts them to release [[antimicrobial substances]].\n\n## C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9: The Membrane Attack Complex\nThe **C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9** complex proteins come together to form the **membrane attack complex**. Basically they come together like Voltron to form a pore in the bacterial membrane and just leak out all the bacteria's insides.  \n## Complement Protein Cascades\n**Complement protein cascades** are like the call to action of the complement system. Once [[#C3]] is cleaved, things can really get going. IT causes the production of other C' proteins, or causes them to get called into action. There are a few different ways to cleave C3. \n\n### The Classical Pathway\n**The classical pathway** is activated when [[antibody|antibodies]] bind to bacterial cells. Then this allows some different complement proteins to bind to the antibody, which causes some differnet things, such as some more cleaving of complement protens, which eventually leads to haveing a C' proten that can bind to [[#C3]], which becomes cleaved, and begins the cascade.\n\n![[the classical pathway complement cascade.png]]\n\n### The Lectin Pathway\n**The lectin pathway** gets kicked off when lectin, a molecule produced by our liver, binds to mannose, a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] that is found on bacteria and viruses. When the C' protein binds to the lecin, that can start the cascade much like the [[#the classical pathway]]. \n\n### The Alternate Pathway\n**The alternate pathway** is a pathway of complement protein cascade that is happening all the time at really low levels, in the hopes that something might catch and snowball. Basically, [[#C3]] is just spontinaiously cleaving, in case C3b binds to a pathogen. If that happens, then the one thing leads to another and it will bind a whole C3, which is once again cleaved, kicking of things in ernest. \n\n## Sialic Acid and Factor H: Protecting Our Own Cells From Complement Proteins\nWe protect our own cells from being bound to by complement proteins with what is called \"complement regulating proteins.\" Our liver produces something called **factor H**, which binds to something that is found on our cells called **sialic acid**.

This is opposed to the [[somatic nervous system]], which deals with stimuli we can perceive.\n\nIn the ANS there are always two sets of neurons: one (the **preganglionic neuron**) that stretches out from the [[central nervous system|CNS]] to a [[nerves|ganglion]], and then one (the **postganglionic neuron**) that stretches from that ganglion to where it meets the effector. \n\nThere are two types of neurons, **adrenergic** and **cholinergic**. **Adrenergic neurons** are any neurons that release [[epinephrine and norepinephrine]], which bind to **alpha** (\u03b1) or **beta** (\u00df) **receptors**. These are always *excitatory*. **Cholinergic neurons** are any neuron that releases [[acetylcholine]] (Ach), which bind to  **nicotinic receptors** or **muscarinic receptors**. Nicotinic receptors are the ones on the neuromuscular junctions and they are always *excitatory*.

The sympathetic division of the ANS is the part that is responsible for the *fight or flight* response we get when we are in danger. For example it increases the [[heart rate]], [[respiration rate]], and the like.\n\nBoth divisions follow the same general arrangement of [[nerves]], where there is a **preganglionic neuron** that attaches the [[spinal cord]] which connects to a **postganglionic neuron** at a [[nerves|ganglion]]. The postganglionic neuron then synapses with the [[synapse|effector]], such as a gland or organ. \n\nThe relative lengths of the pre- and postganglionic nerves, as well as the [[neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]] they use are different between the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] and [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] systems.\n\n![[autonomic nervous system.png]]\n\n## Autonomic Tone\n**Autonomic tone** is a carefully balanced state that an effector organ is in, based on the constant, specific, steady level of stimulation or inhibition from both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions.\n\nThis means different things for different effectors. For example, the **vasomotor tone** is the maintenance of the diameter of most [[blood vessels]]. A steady supply of neurotransmitters from the sympathetic division keeps the blood vessels at a certain diameter; a decrees in that stimulation causes the vessels to dilate, whereas an increase in it causes them to constrict. Another example is the **vagal tone** (so-named due to it traveling along the [[vagus nerve]]) which results in the continued parasympathetic stimulation of the [[autorhythmic cells|pacemaker cells]] of the heart.  \n\n___", "tags": [], "links": ["peripheral nervous system", "autorhythmic cells", "parasympathetic nervous system", "somatic nervous system", "nerves", "acetylcholine", "blood vessels", "respiration rate", "sympathetic nervous system", "central nervous system", "synapse", "vagus nerve", "neurotransmitter", "epinephrine and norepinephrine", "heart rate", "spinal cord"]}];
